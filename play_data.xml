When 9 turns, but far from clean partly because Nemesis came out near the end. Also main scheme went to stage 2 on me :(   

Left juggernaut on the board with his scheme (2 threat) and 7 threat on the main scheme.  This is with an all basic deck. It may not work for SCL, but it can get a win.</comments>

Brutal brutal start to the game for Sp//der.  What&apos;s worse is I made the colossal mistake for not getting Host Spider out in time before the snap and it probably cost me the game.  I had to give up because it was getting long and I was slowly getting beatdown.</comments>

						<comments>S1E1 Wrecking Crew

I&apos;m calling it a win. I was well on the way of taking down Thunderball when my OCTGN game crashed. All I had left was Wrecker. I had enough allies in play to protect myself to finish him off.  I had enough health.

Very slow build being multi villains. I started to get the groove when I got sunfire in play with an attachment plus Thunderstorm to boost his atk to 4 along with two Game Actions.

Another great deck by the master that is VillainTheory:

Wow wow wow.  I thought Sp//der was dead down to 1 HP.  Lots of minions in play.  

Was able to claw my way back to victory.  At that 1 HP level, Sp//der was almost set up. Just needed the Web Compressor.  Got it that turn, and got a handful of All Systems Go... cleared the board.  Took Klaw down within about four more turns. I got VEN#M out as well at almost full counters (saved one for stunning Klaw).

Used VillainTheory&apos;s 20+ damage leadership deck.  Worked great but had to target Miles Morales.  He did 19 damage to finish off Sandman &amp; Rh*no which isn&apos;t too shabby, since he&apos;s not the true target of the deck (Goliath).</comments>

This time my epci turn on the last round to clear 14 threat and 6 enemy HP was done through CITT + What Makes Me stronger to get enough ready on the board to clear Captured by Hydra which thankfully was helped by White Tiger clearing 6 threat on the main scheme.

Another bang up round to clean up the board on an epic final turn of 8.

22+ damage and 6+ threat removal in one go starting alter ego where I could draw up to 8 cards with Rocket&apos;s ability.  I probably saw 12 cards (draw back Starhawk) in that turn.  1 from Knowhere playing StarHawk again plus 2 from murdered you. 

Repurpose deck is just nuts with Rocket. I also had an epic reload with two pistols and a particle cannon.</comments>

Geez! Can&apos;t believe I forgot RR&apos;s &quot;Mudered You!&quot; ability.  Helped finish the game faster for 8 rounds, clean board, 12 health.

Repurpose is just plain nuts!  I saved up two for the last turn and drew a third.  Used murdered you on a Solider to bring in another card. I was able to free a captive (Elektra) which helped me finish the game even faster while clearing a lot of threat.</comments>

I may have gotten a win with the Rogue Go For Champions deck but not sure since I was interrupted. I wasn&apos;t sure if I came back to the right spot in the villain phase.

Worked much better, and didn&apos;t even deck out or go back to AE.  Probably about 5 turn win.</comments>

Long long battle against Klaw, but Rogue took him down. Part of the issue is still getting familiar with her kit and how to use her Touched upgrade properly.

She&apos;s similar to Valkyrie with her Death Glow upgrade, but way way more capable than Valkyrie.  She&apos;s not shutdown completely if she can&apos;t move her Touched upgrade around, but is just lest &quot;optimal&quot; when that happens.

Something I learned, use Energy Transfer first to attach the upgrade, so that you still have an option to move it before you end your turn (like stick it on the villain so Bulletproof Belle works).  Of course, if you use it to soften up a minion, you can then overkill the minion and still attach the upgrade.

Rough on Rogue Justice. I got him to the Physical train attachment fairly quickly, but all starting going down hill.  I&apos;m surprised I lasted as long as I did.  Magnetic Missiles and Electromagnetic Blasts are rough especially on the same turn.

Beat down the villain in a slow burn.  This was more aggression control Wolverine and not a rush down.  May have to retry, but I&apos;m not sure the current deck is built for quick kill.

Gambit starter deck.  Fairly smooth play but still a tough win. Last round was rough when I thought I had him and three sentinels came out, but I was able to do it. Jubilee was the MVP this round working her ability

Rogue starter deck.  I was afraid this was going to be a fast loss, since this was protection and a starter deck.  In other words, not a lot of thwart removal on average, plus her deck was full of janky max 1 player cards.

But oh boy... Karma was the MVP!! I was able to drop her on a sentinel that came out that draws the Energy Barrier.  She took control of it, so I was smacking the stage 3 villain for 5 damage a pop!!! Plus... it kept regenerating a tough status card to keep it alive!!!

Wow!  Karma&apos;s a bleep.

First game with Spider Ham.  It started well, and I&apos;m pretty sure SH could handle it.  I made a mistake somewhere not pushing the end goal harder.  SH was fairly potent.

Masterplan kicked me hard twice putting 8 threat on Sanctuary.  Took me forever to deal with it. Never got damage on Thanos :( 2 accel tokens.  Rough go.  Eventually got snapped then threated it out.

I think I need Ready to Rumbles and Crew Quarters or Endurance.

I had an amazing turn with Nova Force. I can&apos;t count how many cards I was able to play... it was nuts.   One the most fun games I&apos;ve had in a long time on that turn.  Nova can really sing once you get him going.

6HP though.. oof.

Ooof. 18 turns win clean board, that was too long. I think it&apos;s my default playstyle creeping back up to me. Maybe played Moon girl too much?

Wow! Got a clean board win on S1E1 Ronan in 7 turns!!!

Power Drain set actually helps removing all those encounter cards. The 7 card discard one cleared 2 fanaticism.  Also, help that the first couple of turns saw the removal of about 4 attack cards to thin out his double activations.

S1E1 Ronan  -- got the win and I can&apos;t believe it. Way different deck and Target Acquired was MVP.  I was also able to confuse him more reliably and use to my advantage.  Had to cancel a few treachery cards.  I thought the game was over when I about had my board setup, and I almost quit.  Glad I pushed through.  When I had milano, Eye of Agamotto and Quincarrier out I figured  I had enough resource out for the card draw.  I used Chance encounter to get Nick at the end for the final push.  49 card deck plus the Heavy Cannon which was the offensive MVP of the game to keep whiltting Ronan down 2 damage at a time.  Electro came out twice.

Much better standard end than R*nan.  I kept it fairly under control with the precons although right near the end was going to be nasty.  VG got &quot;We are one&quot; and &quot;Advanced Glider&quot; right as I  took him out.  That would have been rough.

S1E2 

Focused less on Cosmo, still got the win in 8 turns almost clean (2nd stage main).  21 health.

I think my biggest problem is taking Red Skull down in one turn to flip him and taking two encounter cards.</comments>

						<comments>Tweak the deck more, and beat S1E1 Hela in Ex campaign.

Helped that Frozen appeared once and SotP didn&apos;t show up at all. Also obligation didn&apos;t hit me.

I put in Stinger as another cheaper ally to get Band Together up more easily.  Captain America because I had Schwarma and got to use him.  I was running four allies a good chunk of the time and Command Center helped as planned especially with Vision and Black Knight.  BK was great for pulling tough off of the big mini boss minions that allowed Valkyrie to clean up with Death Glow combo.

19HP, Odin is King, and Norn Stones really helped Val&apos;s thwart.

I got the win with Valkyrie leadership, but got snapped.  I&apos;m thinking about replaying because I don&apos;t want to go through the rest of the campaign snapped.  Seems tough on Valkyrie if that is the case.

Black Panther finishes in style by turn 12, clean board 18 Health.

I felt better about this round, but the encounter card was slightly kinder in stage 1.  It could have been worse.

Shadows of the Past going into stage 2 or in stage 2 is not too bad at least with Killmonger.  I like to wound him before going to the last stage that way he&apos;s easy to get out of the way to take on final Kang.

I had a couple of bad turns, but I had enough allies out to help mitigate the damage.

This might be the deck I take to official runs.

						<comments>S1E1 Tower Defense Campaign (E)

Started out rough with turn 1 Shadows of the Past, but I was able to battle back for the win.

Thankfully turn 1 I got somewhat built enough to not be completely hampered, but it was a slugfest to make it to the end.

It&apos;s definitely a puzzle for Vision because in the intangible form he can&apos;t defend which means potential damage to the tower.  Dense is almost a must unless you have a chump blocker and not pull a boost that damages the tower.

Much better round. It was long though, but Justice prevailed.  Again, not sure why it did better, unless encounter card draws were nice at the start.  I built and took control. Sonic Rifle is nice, but I may need Side Holster.  Also need Ready to Rumble, because Valkyrie needs to ready when flipping to utilize death glow.</comments>

						<comments>One the cusp of beating S1E1 in Solo Champions league practice round with Thor basic.  A gang up did me in near the end of the game as I was about to turn the corner to start putting Ultron out of commission.

I think I waited too long honestly.  I need to sprinkle in more Hammer Throws and worry too often about threat. maybe.

Using Meditation and Reboots to keep things going.  Using Followed/Chance Encounter to damage villain and get allies on side schemes.

Just a ton of fun. Lost to advance late late in the game with 3 accel tokens.

						<comments>S1E1 Klaw can&apos;t handle the might of normal Vision Justice.

Once locked down, Vision went Dense form to finish him off. Starting to like Venom ally even more now that I  have main scheme under control.  Venom really helps speed the game up with his 3 ATK.  Seems perfect for Klaw scenario and other places with 3 health minions too.

Barely got the win.   Went through encounter deck twice and nemesis showed up on last turn that almost did me in.  I had to think it through to keep from losing to the collection.</comments>

Feeling much more confident and handled more Artifact schemes.  No attachments this time. I&apos;m guessing liberal use of hex bolts etc. keeps some of the nastier stuff from hitting sometimes.   I think I might be ready to do my official rounds.</comments>

Another win against Standard 2 Absorbing Man. 

Quicksilver went a hair slower this time with a rough opening of too many upgrades.  Might have come to finishing in turn 7, but bad villain round slowed me down.

Snap... not scheme out but almost.

I turned Moment of Triumph into &quot;Into the Fray&quot; which gave me enough threat control to finally get the win.. I had one mulligan though.</comments>

						<comments>Expert 1 Thanos goes down to the power of Spectrum Justice. It was a long battle. I had too much thwart in the deck.  Even though it helped bursted down high threat, the turns stalled with no ability to do damage. I should have had Turn the Tides and/or Pivotal Moments in there to accelerate damage. I had practically no issues keeping threat down to nothing on main scheme.

						<comments>Expert Thanos win with Spectrum Aggression mulligan. I let one card go by to see how much easier it is to get snapped.  It can happen. One accel token with one threat went into snap on one AE encounter phase.  Thankfully, I was mostly setup, so it didn&apos;t hurt me too bad.

It took a while, and I wasn&apos;t quite going for the &quot;big finish&quot;, but build up enough ammo counters to keep minions under control. Chasis helped to keep me alive on flips.</comments>

						<comments>This time I played extreme (Expert) Wrecking Crew and still torched them Justice War Machine.  I probably didn&apos;t need Crew Quarters or Sonic Rifle for this.  

It was so much fun pulling Scorched Earth over and over on them.</comments>

						<comments>Official win of Justice Gamora against standard Hela in campaign.   I had a fairly clean game, but I did have to deal an extra encounter card one time to make sure I did it correct on previous side scheme that I might have forgotten to do.

Really excellent scenario.</comments>

						<comments>Gamora against Standard Thanos.  Great game! I barely beat him before his encounter deck ran out.  I had to push for the end and ignore SuperGiant - Plasma Grenade helped me finish him off with just enough damage...barely.

Then, I saw that I played Sanctuary incorrectly! I&apos;ll have to do it all over again :)

						<comments>Didn&apos;t get to complete my first play of Spectrum against Tower Defense Standard. (Corvious and Proxima).   It started good, but was about to fall apart before I had to leave.  Spectrum is definitely trickier to play trying to time her forms and to get you what you need.

						<comments>Tough fight, but Basic Groot prevailed against expert Kang + Anachronauts.

First stage was easy. Second stage was lost super quick.  Third stage was a knock down drag out fight twice coming 1 threat away from loss and lots of minions.

I did miss the stupid future weapon and had to resolve it the turn after.  I hope that okay. The rest was clean.

						<comments>Calling this one a win because I was one turn away and played the high stakes.  I gave myself the mulligan at the end to beat expert Kang + Anachronauts.  Basic Drax worked fairly well, but I had to be super careful about the threat.  Actually didn&apos;t go through the encounter deck until near the end, so Drax got work done with the Knife Leaps and Fight Me Coward. Helped one shot-ing tough minoins with guard out of the way as well.</comments>

						<comments>Tough game against Expert Kang. Thought I was going to lose one time when Depowered had Spiderwoman locked down.  Flipped to Alter-ego and barely survived.... 

Lost second stage, but I was mostly built by then. I think I lost Avengers Mansion twice to Time Travel Hijinks before that.

Cleared the minions at the start of stage 3 because I was in alter-ego.  After that, just worked him down.

						<comments>Expert Kang gets the win against Gamora Basic. I was using most of the Venom basic deck, but took out the Pulse Grenades and Gamora ally, added Endurance and another Hit and Run plus Asses the SItuation.

It was toughter. First stage went fast, but got bogged down in stage 2.  I couldn&apos;t quite get everything setup board wise, because of trying to stabilize, recover, get threat down.  It&apos;s harder without confusion to give time to recover since he schemes for so much.  Lost due to scheme on an Advance... technically twice because I played on

						<comments>Basic Gamora putting the beat down on Expert Kang.  I tweaked the deck by adding another Assess the Situation and put in Ironheart to make up for loss Gamora ally from Basic Venom Deck.  I figured she could use more card draw since she doesn&apos;t have spider sense.  First stage was tough, but I perserved.  Second stage was tricky as well. I decided to let him scheme out into Stage 3 because I was mostly setup.   Burned him down in 2 turns in Stage 3.

						<comments>Putting Expert Kang w/ Anachronauts down with relative ease using a few leadership cards.  Still a good chunk basic.  Added Yondu who never got played. Drax was more MVP especially Inspired + Laser Blaster for one round.  He probably doled out 20+ damage over the course of the game.  Welcome Aboard is nice in Guardian Leadership.

						<comments>Had to restart on what looked like a bad shuffle.  Second go around, Venom took down Expert Kang. It still wasn&apos;t easy with getting Shadows of the Past turn 2.  It felt like Kang was doing his best to keep throwing haymakers at Venom.

						<comments>Expert Kang going down to Venom&apos;s protection over the Guardians.  It took a while to stabilize and first round was rough.  Of course Shadows of the Past comes out eventually.  What was frustrating was how many times I needed to Run and Gun and &quot;Depowered&quot; showed up at the wrong time.

I chose wisely to eventually lose the second stage which turned out for the best because I could handled Depowered yet again in alter ego (start of turn).  I had to use Run and Gun to blow away minions at the start of villain stage 3.

						<comments>Another beat down of Standard Klaw with Gamora Leadership.  Definitely had too many attachments and didn&apos;t use a single one.  Team Training didn&apos;t get into play not for lack of trying being in hand on turn one, just got overruled by Avengers Mansion and Keen Instincts.  Used Get Ready once, but the rest was my allies and hero kit and Knowhere.  Triskelion didn&apos;t get played because I already had knowhere down, so it was less a priority.  I did get up to four allies and came close to a fifth.  Not sure how well the deck would have worked against expert Klaw though because of the clogging up of attachments.   Main scheme stayed on stage 1, but would have definitely gone to stage 2 with Klaw on expert (Stage 3).

						<comments>Wasn&apos;t sure I would beat expert Klaw and Groot Justice.  At one point I had three armored guards in play not sure how I would get them eliminated it.  It took quite a while to stabilize, then I had to rush to finish Klaw with 3 accel tokens on the board.  I finished with a great array of allies (Drax, Rocket, Cosmo, Agent Coulson) and  &quot;I AM GROOT&quot; beat down for 9 damage.

						<comments>Rocket Raccoon getting the drop on Expert Kang with Protection. I focused more on letting allies defend like Groot or getting tough status cards with Perserverance and Muster Courage.  I think that worked out well. I used Energy Barriers as well to help fuel the tech drop.

						<comments>Very tough loss for Rocket Raccoon Leadership against Expert Kang.  I would have had him two turns later after he schemed out on me. It was a epic game too where twice the Masters of Evil side scheme came out and loaded up the minions and got me to 2 accel tokens too fast. I thought for sure I would lose after a boat of minions came out, but I was able to work them down surprising. I learned the value of reload and flora &amp; fauna.</comments>

						<comments>Couldn&apos;t quite get the Leadership as a resource engine going for Drax against expert Klaw.  I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s the right way to build for him.  The resource part works against Drax getting card draw with &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; because the allies are exhausted before they can thwart. I can only run 3 Get Readys. Maybe more Skycycles with more avengers?

						<comments>Okay. win against standard Klaw.  I trashed some cards of Drax&apos;s pre-con. He needed more thwart, so in goes 3 Hard to Ignore from GMW box (Groots pre-con)... that worked great! I add Knowhere and Groot and Desparate Defense along with Power in All of us and Power of Protection.

Worked way better. It was a great game that showcased Drax&apos;s power. I kept in hero form the whole game and once you get 3 vengeance counters on him, he sings!</comments>

						<comments>Got expert Kang this time.  I think I like this Scarlet Witch deck. I still think I maybe moving too slow or have too much support in the deck.  Martial Prowess does get used but maybe not as much as I want.  Helps with Molecular Decay at the end. I had a 21 HP finish for the win. I did purposely lose the second stage to go in fighting on the third stage of Kang.</comments>

						<comments>Tough loss to Expert Kang, but I was working him on 3rd stage.   Just too many acceleration tokens and got locked up. Threat loss. I think the deck was too thick.

						<comments>After thinning my deck down to 40 cards with 3 spiritual medidation and 3 plan of attacks... wow! I almost coasted through expert Kang.  I did lose the second stage due to threat, but that actually worked in my favor.   Losing the second stage of Kang makes it easier to go into stage 3, because you get first crack at Kang and your nemesis.  I was also built up by then as well.</comments>

						<comments>Fudged win against expert Kang and Ms. Marvel Justice.  I forgot to add the standard/expert cards and did until late in the game then flubbed a card. I&apos;ll asterisk it, but it was fun.  Ms. Marvel is quite potent especially when you get the board built out. Having Helicarrier and Skilled Investigator as sacrificial lambs was helpful to keep more important cards in play.

						<comments>Beat Expert Kang with Aggression Scarlet Witch.  That was very nice.  First stage was rough staying ahead of him.  It took me forever to get to the point I could start dealing damage to him and I thought I would lose to threat a couple of times.

						<comments>Oh yeah, this was the epic win against Expert Red Skull I was looking forward to see.  Just as things were about to look grim with RS putting 10 threat (almost a loss) on the main scheme and pull out more side schemes.  I pulled the epic finish.  I had 10 cards in hand at the start of my turn.  Avengers Mansion to go to 11 cards.  Play two cards to put Maria Hill in play and draw two cards with her and Knowhere! Back to 11.  I had 3 Sliding Shots in my hand!  Red Skull had tough and 15 HP (and retaliate). Star Lord was at 4 HP. I had two Gutsy Moves in hand!  Four allies down on the board!

Guess what I cleared the board of threat, played Iron Heart, and drew a third Gutsy Move and cycled my deck!  I had hit him for 13 HP right before that, but then I was doing 17 HP of damage with a sliding shot to take him out and enough cards to play another 17 HP sliding shot!</comments>

						<comments>Very close loss against Expert Red Skull.  The deck was just starting to stabilize and I was probably one turn away from turning the corner, but he schemed for 9 threat!!!! Just enough to lose.  Boy, I miss Under Surveilance.

						<comments>Okay correct milano upgrade this time.  I took out Standard Ronan using the optional rule not to include the Kree Supremacy and my own variant to start with Milano upgrades.  It was no cakewalk still, but I barely made. He advanced to second stage very fast.  It was hard dealing with the power stone to remove threat and get rid of Cut the Power.  Thankfully, the Universal Weapon stayed buried in the encounter deck until the very last round which I survived because I had him stunned!!!  I&apos;m not sure I would have survived at 6 HP if he drew another attack with the universal weapon and getting an extra boost card.</comments>

						<comments>Standard Drang going down to the blade of Gamora Aggression with a Decisive Blow. Epic. She had him mostly under control and kept the threat down most of the time.  Had one turn that almost advanced to stage 2, but didn&apos;t. That was the next turn where I cleaned up. 10 HP, got the Badoon Blitz and the Badoon Headhunter for maximum points to take to the Market.

						<comments>Standard Collector Infiltrate the Museum going down to Gamora.

						<comments>This time going against standard Ultron went much better.  Getting Gamora&apos;s Sword down is critical for managing drones.  Her ability pop a damage when a thwart event is played helps, but couple with the sword and she&apos;s dealing another damage to a drone on an attack event.  </comments>

						<comments>Another Gamora win pre-con against standard Collector Escape the Museum.  It was a tougher game, because it took me a while to get Keen Instincts and Conditioning Room down. I even went through my deck once.  I had a very bad villain phase that pulled out a lot of minions, but I was able to work them down over two rounds. </comments>

						<comments>Trounced Standard Collector - Escape the Museum with Captain Marvel/Justice.  However it wasn&apos;t quite legit, because I forgot I                    take out the basic two resource cards I had from Quicksilver, because I had the PNP cards for Captain Marvel.

						<comments>Yes, this time Quicksilver does the standard Collector Escape the Museum this time. It took much longer and I was in stage 2 for a LONG time setting up.  However, when I was ready, I hit the afterburners to remove 12 threat for the win and burned through stage 3 in one go.  4 threat was left on stage 2, and QS was bumped up to 3 THW per action and then I added Maximum Velocity to 5 THW per action.   This is the way to win it if you want to be prepared to finish off the Collector and not waste time dealing with the Collector&apos;s ship hitting you every villain phase.</comments>

						<comments>Quicksilver Justice against Standard Collector Escape the Museum.  Epic payback with a 3 turn win was quite impressive. It helped getting Hyper Velocity down for the extra thwart (4 thw a turn).  I also took two encounter cards to get rid of 10 threat for speed things up.

						<comments>One rule tweak. Milano upgrades are permanent setup at the start of Standard Ronan campaign encounter.  Finally, I got the win, but it was not easy at all. One of the toughest battles I faced, but this feels more balanced.  It came down to the wire. Ronan at 1HP, and I had 2 HP.  I had to survive one more encounter with him hitting for 5ATK plus overkill and the environment that does 1 damage at the end of the villain phase.  I survived with no damage because of Armored plating and got the win.  These feels like a more balanced rule tweak for solo campaign.</comments>

						<comments>Much better round with Groot Protection against expert Klaw.  It took a long time to get him down.  At one point, things were looking grim when there six minions on the board, and I was fighting to stay afloat.  Three of those minions were armored guards and two where beefy masters of evil.  It took a while to get them chipped away.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this match went 1.5 to 2 hours to finally beat him down. I didn&apos;t waste any resources getting rid of his attachmments.</comments>

						<comments>Epic! Epic game against Expert Kang and Rocket Aggression! Wow! Lots of lows to fight through for the eventual win! I did lose the 2nd stage not without trying.  I fought hard, but I was struggling to stabilize just as I was making progress on stage 2.  I found out it&apos;s not as painful ending stage 2 on the villain phase (scheme out), because I get my turn after that at the start of stage 3.  It was still a tough battle to get stable when I had to flip to almost recover and then get threat back down.  It&apos;s tough in aggression even with Rocket&apos;s high thwart capacity.  I had a blast though getting that win finally.

						<comments>Insane ride again with Rocket on expert Ultron.  Cooking all the crazy sauce with Rocket Launcher, Hall of Heroes, Schadenfreude, and alter ego ability.  Follow throughs were nice getting that extra punch with Relentless Assault or Particle Cannon.

						<comments>Tentative Victory against Standard Ronan.  I had to replay the first villain phase again because I misdealt encounter cards.  I may dealt one less another time though so I can&apos;t call it a clean win plus I might have missed the Pincer maneuver side scheme.

						<comments>Cleaner game against Standard Ronan.  He schemed out, but I lasted much longer by getting the Universal Weapon and Kree Supremacy out of play turn one.  Yes, I had to take four encounter cards still, but that universal weapon gone also makes a big difference.  You can now confuse and stun Ronan if necessary plus less atk and sch.</comments>

						<comments>Second go around with Standard Nebula went better.  Ant-Man justice got her down before the player deck ran out and just as the encounter deck ran out. I read the rules better in that I was handling the attachments wrong and did do the evasion counter removal correctly the first time.  It wasn&apos;t easy, and I tad lucky with Shadows of the Past going away on the opening draw and so few minions coming out.

						<comments>Standard Ronan... Ant-Man Justice.  Got beat down in turn 3, and I think I would have died in turn two because I forgot about all those stupid encounter cards.  You start out with four encounter cards in the villain phase!!!! Stupid Pincer Manuever is a second side scheme added to the mix for campaign with a wonky threat addition if you did well with evasions counters in the previous scenario. Ugh.

Spent all my units for a 4 cost card by the way. I got the armor plating to help with the beat down.  Never came out and none of the Milano upgrades came out.</comments>

						<comments>Did much better this time against Standard Collector Escape the Museum.  I focused more on natural thwart abilities and didn&apos;t try to get the standard challenge side scheme until the end instead of at the beginning.  I used Hyper Thrusters to good use and got the Milano out in turn one. That worked much better.  Hyper Thrusters kept whittling down the side scheme threat while working the main scheme.  

Down to 1 HP when I finished.  4 Units and spent all four to get the Heavy Cannon for Milano.</comments>

						<comments>Standard Nebula is tough. I almost got the win had I not got schemed out on the last turn.  I didn&apos;t handle any of the evasion counters because they&apos;re so expensive.  I can&apos;t imagine winning the game with one or less evasion counters.</comments>

						<comments>Aggression Ant-Man against Standard Drang in the campaign setting.  Fun challenge.  The Badoon minions definitely add some annoying twists.  I did get the headhunter for 2 victory points.  I think my total is 4.  It took a little while, but I got the victory.  Double Hand Cannons were nice when I got to use them, but too many times I had to defend so didn&apos;t use them as much.  Follow Through unfortunately never got put down at all because of prioritizing over Ant-man upgrades, so I didn&apos;t get amazing overkills.

						<comments>Justice Ant-man makes it in to the museum against Standard Collector - Infiltrate the Museum.  Oh boy it was HARD! I can&apos;t image this on expert where he gets to start with two of your cards in the collection.  Plus, how many cards you going to lose out of your expert deck for the rest of the campaign!!!

I tried hard to minimize the allies in play. Wiccan was a MVP putting out damage with thwart.  Those Galactic Artifacts are just nasty.  I wish that you could free up more cards from the collection beyond one per round.

						<comments>First play with Rocket Raccoon against Standard Green Goblin Mutagen.  Very enjoyable with his pre-con aggression deck.  He&apos;s potent solo because he can thwart very well and do great damage.  Having minions helps since some of his cards keys off a minions . The only challenge is keeping track of restricted weapons.

						<comments>First play with Groot pre-con protection against Standard Green Goblin Mutagen.  He&apos;s a lot harder to pilot then Rocket because he doesn&apos;t have consistent good thwart.  He can put out the damage though with Fighting Fit, I AM GROOT, and Root Stomp cards.  Now, we can do some major thwart at times, but he gets behind between rounds too easily.  Needs more allies to help with thwart.</comments>

						<comments>Epic win against Expert Ultron.  I thought I had lost after spending almost everything I had with two hammer throws and Janborn to get Ultron down to 3 health (had to take out two drones to do it with him in Stage 3).  As I was bout to except defeat with Ultron ready to scheme out for the win in the last stage, I realized I had one shot by going alter-ego and using Hall of Heroes.  I flipped and drew Wasp! I had enough energy to put her in place to punch Ultron down for the win!

						<comments>Expert Ultron.  Tough loss with Hawkeye aggression.  It started out well other than getting beat down on the first turn.  Got some clogged hands I have to rethink and Wasp was bad for this hand (not enough energy to play her).  Threat loss.

						<comments>* Asterisk win against Expert Zola because I did one cheat on a draw because I was doing well and I want to see what happened if I had reversed order of cards.  It turned in a long brutal battle of a win. I thinned my deck way down and I think it did better overall.  I had Spiritual Mediation which I didn&apos;t count as my deck size given the fact that the cards replace themselves as a filter, so even though I had 43 cards, I treated it as 40.</comments>

						<comments>Took down expert Klaw with Antman Justice.  It worked really well and felt almost too easy. i didn&apos;t need the Beat Cops, and I wonder if I put more Lay down the Law and Running interference if that might have been better. I did use Crisis Averted once to get the threat way down.

						<comments>&quot;Grey&quot; Hulk taking on expert Ultron with nothing but basic cards.   It was a very close and tough game even with a near perfect opening first turn.  I was get both Avengers Mansion and Immovable Object down on turn 1.  If I had one more turn, I might have beaten Ultron... maybe, but the threat was too much to handle.  Also getting exhausted by that stupid expert card came at a bad time.

						<comments>I&apos;ll have to asterisk this win, Standard Ultron, because I did cheat a tad to see how things play out.  This was standard difficulty this time and it took a while for Avengers Mansion and Immovable object to show up that slowed way down and seems more typical of a normal game.  I think this might make a good solo challenge.  I don&apos;t know how players will play this without Beat &apos;em up (wasp pack?).</comments>

						<comments>Putting expert Zola down with a webbed-up and double swinging web kick! 13 HP left, no minions in play, and Black Cat freed from Hydra Prison for an improved thwart upgrade.

I almost feel like Spiderman is too easy in this campaign, because Aunt May can heal him up real quick.

Invalid game because I put incorrect amount of threat at the start.

Bad loss though.  Sleeper on first turn.  Nemesis on third turn with many minions already coming out... ugh.

Much better round this time with correct threat at the start.  Aunt May came out on the first round which took forever the first round.  I never missed her so much.

Turn the Tide was very effective.  Got the board built out and took Red Skull down.</comments>

						<comments>Spiderman justice prevails over expert Taskmaster. I sprinkled in the Concussive Blows and Skilled Investigator in place of Turn the Tides.  I figured I need to maximize my time on getting more encounter cards than doing damage.  I may rethink this going into Red Skull where I want more damage. Same for Zola.

12 HP and 3 captives freed: Moon Knight, White Tiger, and Elektra.   When I saw I missed my opportunity to get Shang Chi early in the second round of the encounter deck, I decided to finish off Taskmaster in good fashion.  I didn&apos;t want to play another hour to cycle the encounter deck.</comments>

						<comments>Got expert Crossbones this time.  Seemed like most cards fell into my hand at the right time a lot.  Epic feel.  Even with Madame Hydra coming out at the end, I was able to finish off Crossbones with yet another Swinging Web Kick.  I was able to cancel a Full Auto with Spider Sense right before that turn where I would have taken heavy damage.

13HP, only two experimental weapons in the deck because of Under Surveillance kept him at the first stage.   Taking Tactical Scanner.</comments>

						<comments>Played  both heroes: Protection Quicksilver and Justice Scarlet Witch against expert Green Goblin Mutagen Formula.  Man, long game, but I prevailed.  I think I could have been a tad more aggressive earlier.  However, it is still good to handle minions in the second stage of the villain scheme since threat goes up by the number of goblins in play.

I did make mistakes playing the signature allies when I should not have. I corrected one mistake though.

						<comments>Great win against standard Taskmaster in the Excelsior challenge (Alter Ego only).  Black Widow I think did a better job than  She-hulk.  Of course the first five or six turns were tough getting established and keeping threat down.  Once all beat cops were in play, then I rest way easier.  Black Widow has the advantage over a lot of heroes in that she can confuse the villain and remove 4 threat (Covert Ops) in alter-ego mode.  This is key to freeing captives too.  Also, she has a lot of prep cards that even though that don&apos;t function in alter-ego mode, they thin your deck way down so you&apos;re cycling Cover Opts, allies, counterintelligence, spycraft, and espionages.

						<comments>Tougher match against expert Rhino this time.  I came close to losing and it was all down to the last turn where I had to take him out or lose.  Of course, he had a Hydra Soldier to guard him... grrr.  I had to take out both, but I was able to plan out my hand to take care of it all which was sweet.  Swift Retribution put him down.

						<comments>Iron Man/Justice prevails over expert Red Skull.  It wasn&apos;t too bad of a round and was mostly domination.  Supersonic punch for the finishing move. I even forgot to use Tactical Scanner.

						<comments>Better win against expert Zola and Iron Man/Justice.  It helped getting Under Surveillance early, so I was more comfortable flipping back and forth while ignoring Zola most of the game.  It was a long game, because I waited to get my board built up and then wanted to make no minions were in play before finishing off Zola.  I didn&apos;t want another potential five encounter card round with Red Skull next game.   Finished with 13 HP and rescued War Machine for the Improved thwart upgrade.</comments>

						<comments>First play of Scarlet Witch. I used her pre-con deck against Rhino.  Wow! She&apos;s cray good. I&apos;m not sure I really broke a sweat with her.  She has some crazy good thwart and great allies.  I love her &apos;Turn the Tide&quot; card to do 3 damage after clearing thwart from a scheme which can stack for multiple attacks on different enemies or the same.  She doesn&apos;t have a lot of support, but what little she has is great.  Spiritual Meditation is great for crafting your hand and combine that with Agatha Harkness!

Anyway.. easy win.

						<comments>This time, Justice worked better taking down expert Absorbing Man.  Iron Man was able to dish out most of the damage and handle the thwart with the boosted Justice cards and Heroic Intution.  I even gave up Avenger&apos;s Mansion and Quincarrier to get allies and gear down.</comments>

						<comments>Tough loss with Iron Man Leadership against expert Crossbones. Everything got thrown at me and I just could not keep up. I was using allies as resources which meant getting behind on minions to some degree.  I did get all the armor out, but boy was it tough getting there.  Legions of Hydra came out. Whiplash came out! Threat finally got me.   I&apos;ll have to rethink my strategy, because threat management is a big problem until you can get your hand size up to a decent level.

						<comments>Expert Red Skull easily controlled for a win. It was a long game, but I did well considering it was going to be a rough start.  It started on 2nd main scheme stage plus three extra encounter cards and two sides which made for two more drawn encounter cards (5 encounter cards for 1st villain phase). I burned that tactical scanner thin and there to get up to 11 cards for building the board.   Came close to losing to threat once the villain phase right after I played Under Surveillance for 13 threat!!

						<comments>Expert Taskmaster too easy. Black Panther Justice prevails without really breaking a sweat.  First time using Sense of Justice card to power thwart events leaving Quincarrier alone to power captive ally abilities or Wakanda Forever.  13 HP, Shang Chi, White Tiger, and Moon Knight rescued.

						<comments>Finally got the win with Aggression Black Panther.  I decided to go slow and thin my deck some more.  I focused more on establishing allies more than upgrades and used the upgrades as resources until I could feel like I could put down upgrades.  It took forever, so I will have to start last scenario at 2nd main scheme stage (11 counters?).  10 HP though.  It was tough with nemesis showing up and all the curveballs that threw me along with Absorbing Man&apos;s traits.  Expert Absorbing man is probably the swingest of all the villains I think.</comments>

						<comments>Hmm... another loss to expert Absorbing man with BP aggression.  I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;m doing wrong.  I was actually not too far off, but he won on threat.  I wonder if I should just ignore the delay counters and use allies to block until BP is setup....

						<comments>Finally, legit win against expert Red Skull this time with DS Justice.  I put the proper threat at the beginning.  Overall it went smoother this time, since I didn&apos;t get swamped by minions early on like last time.  However, I did come close to losing to threat twice and I was glad I had &apos;Under Surveillance&apos; down.

						<comments>Big loss to expert Crossbones with Leadership Black Panther.  I wanted to try something different and using the buff up big ally strategy again and it didn&apos;t work again.  It didn&apos;t help that Shadows of the Past showed up and Legions of Hydra.  I wonder if there is too much competition between the allies, the buffs, and BP&apos;s gear that I can&apos;t do much. I wonder if usig allies as a resource is a better plan.  Draw up the allies to get more cards.</comments>

						<comments>Going to have to put an asterisk on this one. I forgot to add the threat based on number of delay counters at the start.  Tough game anyway and almost lost (down to 1HP), and I fought my way back.  Justice Doctor Strange vs. Expert Red Skull.  I got way behind the minions even with allies.  I had to scratch and claw my way back.  I had a bad villain round with some bad treachy cards.  A boost that caused a villain activation with no boost cards about killed me.

						<comments>Expert Absorbing Man goes down in five turns with Dr. Strange/Aggression.  Crimson Bands was too strong in the end while getting it played three times in a row. First two hits were in one turn, and the finishing move in the second turn.  This was aiding by the two Master of Mystic Arts to keep the Crimson Bands in play.

						<comments>Expert Crossbone met his match with Protection Dr. Strange.  Multiple Man came out at the right time to get toughed up with the Seven Rings of Raggadorr to help the good doctor to get setup.  Along with the stunning of Iron Fist and Vapors to keep Multiple men in play longer, gave more time for board setup.  Crossbones was defeated.

12HP left, picked the Tactical Scanner as reward.

						<comments>Finally, I got a victory with Aggression Quicksilver against expert Rhino! Tough fought battle.  I think I did a better job of utilizing my allies better as shields and helpers more this time instead of getting blinders on making QS do everything.  It allowed me to setup better and I did make good choices when going back to alter-ego when I had too.

						<comments>Yet another loss to expert Crossbones.  I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing wrong. I added more first aids to stay in hero form... didn&apos;t hardly use them.  I tried to play more aggression, but still not using it much.  I either get behind in threat or behind in health. I almost feel like I don&apos;t know how to play after so many losses.

						<comments>Finished off Expert Zola with She-Hulk Leadership.  Giant Man was the MVP with his Reinforced Suit and Team Building Exercise to bump him up to 7HP for hitting longer at 4 ATK.  It was touch and go as She-Hulk got down to 2 HP, but a big finish with the arrival of White Tiger and Elektra to help free Hell Cat and get the big win.

						<comments>Torched expert Red Skull with She-Hulk Justice.  I can&apos;t believe I took him down so fast, but it helped getting two captive allies (Moon Knight &amp; Shang Chi) in my opening hand and able to use their abilities along with getting QuinCarrier down all in turn one.  No threat, side scheme removed and ready for 3 encounter cards.   Elektra was MVP getting 15 damage done by recurring her through prison camp.   I could have ended the game a turn earlier because I forgot to use the Laser Cannon.</comments>

						<comments>Crushed the expert Red Skull in the final round with Captain America Leadership.  Red almost defeated Captain America knocking him down to 1HP, but he was able to rally for a glorious finish.  Tactical Scanner was the MVP card of the game.  It was the first card I played at the start to help set my board up with quite a few cards.  Then came back in the final round at the right time.  My deck was almost empty after I fought my way back out of my 1HP hole.  Red Skull was sitting at 16HP (second stage).  I play Tactical Scanner to start my turn and draw 5 (at 10) cards because of Assess the Situation previous round).  I defeat Censor the Past side scheme to shuffle Tactical Scanner back into the deck and then draw two cards from Skilled Investigator and Improved Thward Upgrade (12 cards).  I play Fearless Determination to then draw Tactical Scanner again!!  I draw 5 more cards and triggers a reshuffle (16 cards).  I play Moon Knight and use Quincarrier to draw two more cards (17 cards) and draw Tactical Scanner AGAIN!!!!!  I draw 5 more cards (21 cards!!).

						<comments>Long game, but Expert Zola went down to the power of Captain America Leadership.  10 HP.  I did free Agent 13.  I had the big finish with &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; (2 assess situations previous round), Steve&apos;s Apartment to to draw up to 13 cards in the round then finish off with Avenger&apos;s Assemble and shield toss (eliminate a guard). 21 total damage.    Giant man with reinforced suit is wicked good because it keeps him punching at 4ATK.</comments>

						<comments>Captain America Justice takes down Taskmaster.  I only freed two captives though: Moon Knight and Shang Chi.  It will have to do. I didn&apos;t feel like playing another hour just to free the other two who came up during boost draws.

13 HP.  Tactical Scanner, 5 delay counters, Basic Thwart Upgrade</comments>

						<comments>Much better round against expert Absorbing Man.  I took him down in 5 rounds with 11 HP (full health).  I took the tactical scanner but didn&apos;t use it this round and may not ever use it.  I may take the basic thwart upgrade this time for fun.</comments>

						<comments>Captain America/Aggression throttles expert Crossbones in no time.  I didn&apos;t even use Heroic Strike nor did I finish going through my deck once.  Took all the experimental weapons though.  I haven&apos;t decided item to select.  11 HP full health, so no obligation cards this round.</comments>

						<comments>Again, I went against expert Red Skull with Back Widow/Justice.  Started out rougher, but worked my way through it.  I technically didn&apos;t finish, but I had complete control.  He was at 9HP left, I had 13 HP, three alliles, five preps down and near full board.   I had him next turn if a guard doesn&apos;t show up.  I had to run an pick up Zoe from dance.</comments>

						<comments>Good game against Expert Zola and Black Widow Leadership deck.  Ant man cards are so nice with the new upgrades for Iron Man and Giant Man with his big punch of 4.  The game got a little dicey in the early rounds as Black Widow was down to 2 HP setting up her board, but I eventually got enough allies down and Triskelion to do some work.  Ended with full heath of 13HP.</comments>

						<comments>Expert Absorbing Man schemed out on me on the first try with Black Widow/Aggression.   It was a tad slow and he was at 8 delay counters already and I probably had two turns to go.  Taskmaster nemesis showed up as well to slow things down more.</comments>

						<comments>Took Expert Absorbing man down in 6 turns this time.  Things went a tad smoother, but still tough.  I was able to finish out with Valkyrie, Dance of Death, and Upper Cut.  Martial Prowess and QuinCarrier came in handing.  Ended with 6HP though, so I&apos;m taking the Basic Recovery Upgrade.</comments>

						<comments>Finally I beat expert Taskmaster and Thor Justice.  I did a better job of managing threat and keeping the attachments at a minimum.  It was a long game, but I shut it down after freeing two captives: Moon Knight and Shang Chi. I&apos;ll have to go with that.  17 HP which means I start next round with 15 HP so I don&apos;t need to take yet another obligation card this time.</comments>

						<comments>2nd try with Thor Protection against Expert Crossbones in RoRS.  I took him down, but it was a tough fight.  I did better with the scheme, no Loki, but the scheme did get to stage 3.   I came close to losing with the Full Auto showing up before final turn. Drew 6 cards on Full Auto an barely survived to be able to finish off Crossbones.  I was down to 1 HP, but I put the helmet down to &quot;heal&quot; me to six before finishing him off with a Hammer Throw (very fitting).  Iron Fist saved my butt the last two turns.</comments>

						<comments>Solo Champions League Season 2 Round 3 Match 3 - Standard Ultron/Legions of Hydra with Captain Marvel Leadership.  Tougher start without Hawkeye.  I shifted my plan to U.S. Agent to be a drone sponge to eliminate drones with his retaliate and buffed with Honorary Avenger.  That helped but meant captain Marvel took more damage.   Unfortunately, I almost went to stage 3 of the scheme when I went alter ego to heal up. Survived.  I was able to Make the Call to get Hawkeye finally into play.  The biggest play was to flip Ultron to Stage II ad double tap with Goliath to do 10 damage!  Finished Ultron in two more turns with a win in turn 7.  It got a little hair there.</comments>

I basically &quot;skipped&quot; the turn in alter-ego and figured I could deal with the extra threat with Rhino scheming on turn 1.  It worked out okay.  I took him down in 6 turns. Much better.</comments>

						<comments>Took down expert TaskMaster with Ms. Marvel Justice.  Mostly controlled him even though it got a little hairy when my nemesis came out.  Thankfully, I was in alter ego and had a big hand draw round with my support in place to work them back down.  Loving the new Justice cards from RoRS in this set (Clear the Area &amp; Skilled Investigator). Combine it with Concussive Blow to allow Ms. Marvel to go into alter-ego mode along with Beat Cop to absorb threat each round and Under Surveillance for cushion. It&apos;s sweet.   14 HP.  Rescued White Tiger, Elektra, and Shang Chi</comments>

						<comments>Taking down expert Taskmaster with Spiderwoman. Too easy. In complete control by the time I had two Finesses, Jessica&apos;s Apartment, Beat Cop, Martial Prowess, and Spycraft down.   I just milked it out until I got the last allied rescued (3 total). 12 HP!  It&apos;s so much easier I think to capture allies here in expert using stun and confuse a lot and Spiderwoman can do this with Pheromones.</comments>

						<comments>First round against expert Zola... oof. That was rough.  Took way too many turns to get my quiver which was almost at the end of my deck:(  I think I spent too much time not flipping Zola because of the minion draw, when I probably should have flipped him a long time ago. Those minions are brutish! He can go through his deck fast with pseudo surges searching for minions and then tech for zola mutates.</comments>

						<comments>Solo Champions League Round 4 match 2. Black Panther / Leadership against Ultron Bomb Scare Expert.  Turn 14 win.  Tough battle.  It took a while to get Black Panther&apos;s upgrade train going.  
I had reshuffled my deck to get 3 wakanda forevers in hand to get Ultron flipped and down to 17 even while clearing minions.  Next 3 turns was almost all allies with all the defending BP had to do against upgraded drones  (+3rd stage Ultron upgrade).  Took two Make the Calls to Nick Fury to get Ultron down to 3.  Last hand was to play Hawkeye to clear last drone than Make the Call to get Wonder Man to land the killing blow. BP was exhausted.  Allies for the win!
I was so hoping to draw one more Wakanda forever to finish up Ultron those last three turns, but couldn&apos;t do it.
I had to let the main scheme go to stage 3 at turn 14 too, figure it was better than clearing more minions to finish off Ultron.

						<comments>Solo Champions League Round 4 Match 1 - Black Panther Leadership against Ultron Expert with Bomb Scare. Turn 11.

Tough match, but I pulled it off. I think I like how my deck worked with the extra cards to mitigate the drone minion pull on my deck so I feel like I have options to replace cards that get converted.  My deck was 46 cards. The extra six cards seemed like a good number with how many drones happen between going through my whole deck . I went through it twice.  In stage two of villain, it is very easy to do two drones per villain phase without extra treachery cards.

Falcon came in handy getting the threat down.  I used almost every ally at least once... except mockingbird surprisingly.  I did consider using &quot;blockingbird&quot; though but went with something else at the time to get more thwart.  I think it was Iron man who got some work done.  It took forever to get Hawkeye out. I gave him up first hand to get and Avengers Mansion down and I&quot;m ot sure if that was a good tradeoff. However, it helped getting him again eventually.</comments>

						<comments>Another win with Black Panther Aggression on standard Klaw with MODOK.  Definitely need the allies to keep Black Panther in the game while laying out the board.  BP seems slower than I would expect.  Mean Swing is so nice since BP comes with two weapons that can be exhausted that don&apos;t stop their special ability.</comments>

						<comments>WOW.  Klaw + MODOK could have been more rough. MODOK came out in turn 4, I had to sit and think awhile.  I decided to ignore him and go for finishing off Klaw and hope a guard didn&apos;t come out.  I made it at turn 6.. phew. 3 Avengers Mansion probably helped.</comments>

						<comments>Long tough win against Standard Klaw Masters of Evil with Black Widow Leadership.  I&apos;ll have to asterisk this one because I didn&apos;t play Klaw&apos;s stun converter correctly, it should have been stunning my blockers (although he was killing them). I need to figure out the attacrobatics interaction with stun converter plus stun on me and widowmaker interaction. I&apos;m thinking attacrobatics does nothing and widowmaker doesn&apos;t fire</comments>

						<comments>Rhino Standard with Masters of Evil.  Probably would have been a cakewalk but Nemesis and Obligation showed up in first two turns.  Baron Mordo is so annoying and his counterspells too!</comments>

						<comments>First time playing Doctor Strange. Prebuilt deck. Ultron Standard with Under Attack.. Wow. Put the hurt on Ultron. First solid win with Protection. The cards are just too good. Unflappable... wow!  Desperate Defense is not too shabby in a pinch!  Iron fist is worth the 4 cost!

Then there is Doctor Strange&apos;s hero/invocation decks... wow.</comments>

						<comments>Solo Champions Leage Round 2 match 1 - loss.  Standard Ultron. I had everything go wrong in one turn - nemesis and obligation!  I let Invasive AI stay on the board too long (extra encounter card). Got beat down at the end of turn 7.

						<comments>Standard Rhino. Tried Thor taking Avengers Mansion and QuinCarrier out and putting two haymakers in for damage and energy.  Worked well. Slow game only because it took a while to get Asgard down... I think.    Of course, having Under Surveillance down makes me slow down I think.  I&apos;m more okay with going alter-ego to heal when I have threat down.   I did a turn with two hammer throws off and then a later turn with 8 damage lightning strike!</comments>

						<comments>I&apos;m liking Thor Justice now, but I&apos;m still a fan of Justice.

Second Match of Round 1 Solo Champions League.
Rhino Standard + Masters of Evil
7 Turns
5 health left
0 villain + minions
0 threat

Good win.  I would have had Rhino in 6 if it wasn&apos;t for the tough status showing up to extend it one more round.</comments>

						<comments>Amazing win with Black Widow aggression. Standard Wrecking Crew. I was inspired by Frankie (aka BrokenAxe) to try this after his SGOYT post about his experience.  She rocked the crew and kept them under control. She became a beast once she got Endurance and Down Time down.  Counterattack was critical many times and got me the final blow on Wrecker.</comments>

						<comments>Rough and long game against Green Goblin Mutagen Formula.  Jachin nearly got knocked out and I got down to 4HP.  We were able to claw our way back to victory with a quite a walloping in the last round.  Jachin drew a ton of cards to really do some work taking out the Goblin Thralls and getting GG down to 3 hp.  Ms. Marvel tackled him for the finish.</comments>

						<comments>I tested out a play against Rhino Expert/Under Attack before playing the offiical solo league match with Black Widow. I&apos;ve never played Expert before, and I know BW is going to have trouble with her lower HP count.  I chose Captain America so I would feel cheating since the league game is a one-shot attempt.   Let&apos;s just say Cap&apos;n crushed it in 5 turns.  Rhino came at him with double charge, but shield block stopped the 10 HP attack.  BW would not have handled that well.   The match would have been 4 turns but the stupid Vibranium armor slowed things down.</comments>

						<comments>Season 0 of league play
Black widow with my first custom deck. I tweak a few cards.

Played Rhino Standard with Masters of Evil.  It got touchy around turn 3 &amp; 4 where health got down to 3, but I was able to storm bag with plenty of prep cards. Counter Surveillance came in handy giving me breathing room to heal up while the villain schemed.  After that, I was able to cruise and manage things until I put the final blow with a prep card combo for the hit.  I had both gauntlets down and plenty of prerparation cards in the tableau by turn 6.  Espionage didn&apos;t come into play, but it might prove more useful against Klaw&apos;s Weapons Runners</comments>

						<comments>Played against Rhino with Black Widow.  She&apos;s pretty cool. I kind of like her and is probably my favorite female superhero to play.  I like the way her &quot;Preparation&quot; card combs work.  She kind feels like Iron Man/BP, but her &quot;armor&quot; only sticks around until used.</comments>

Captain America just shellacked them.  I took out PileDriver first round to avoid his Distracting Taunts.  Shield Tosses put a hurt on everyone and a couple of Heroic Strikes to stun the active villain.  Bulldozer was second to go, then Thunderball who got one stun in, then finally wrecker.</comments>

						<comments>Thor against Ultron.  Took him down but it was close.  Thor did better with more minions in play so he could draw 2 extra each phase he was in hero form.  It was a very satisfying end to the game where Ultron&apos;s countdown just started, Thor&apos;s obligation came out as Thor had 5 remaining hit points, Ultron was at 8 hit points... what do you do?  I chose to exhaust (already in Odinson) to remove card. Flip to Thor and use Hammer throw for the finish!</comments>

						<comments>First time playing Thor and second time with the Wrecking Crew.  It seemed fitting since the two go together based on the early comics.  Thor fared better than Iron Man/Justice, but I just couldn&apos;t finish them.  It dragged out a long time, but they schemed out. I was possibly too aggressive with the Defender of the Nine Realms card plays because it makes them cycle their deck faster which leads to acceleration tokens (more threat in the long run), but Thor doesn&apos;t have much besides that card to deal with threat.</comments>

						<comments>We beat expert Rhino with Bomb Scare.  Tough game even with three players. It actually came down to a round where we really had to take him out or we schemed out. She-Hulk was down to 1 hit point and almost died.</comments>

						<comments>Still can&apos;t beat Klaw with She-Hulk/Justice. Most of the time it&apos;s a scheme problem.  I get behind on those stupid minions like the armored guard keeping the guard in play to keep me from hitting klaw at the wrong time.</comments>

						<comments>Good game against Klaw 1/2 with Masters of Evil. I played She Hulk/Justice and Jachin was Iron Man/Aggression.  We handled the threat decently, and I finished him off. I thought She-Hulk was going to get knocked out and Jachin would have to take out the villain at 1HP.  However, I forgot that I could go alter-ego to avoid getting knocked out with 4HP.  That pushed his scheme to the next level, but Klaw was dealt with after that phase.</comments>

						<comments>Fought Klaw again and Masters of Evil. I was playing She-Hulk with Justice Aspect, and I almost beat Klaw. I learned the value of Avengers Mansion which really helps She-Hulk in Hero Form.  Focused Rage is useful too in combo with Avengers Mansion to get yet another extra card (for 2 more).  The damage from Focused Rage can help setup for Gamma Slam which turned out to be my undoing. Even though I nailed Klaw for 14 damage, I couldn&apos;t quite survive the villain round when he drew Sound Manipulation to kill me.  Good game!</comments>

						<comments>Jachin and I took on Klaw with BP/Leadership and She-Hulk/Protection.   Got beat, even though I felt like we were on the cusp. Jachin felt like he couldn&apos;t draw enough Wakanda Forevers to get going. I really struggled with She-Hulk&apos;s crummy hero hand size to be effective.</comments>

						<comments>Beat the Klaw with Panther Leadership.  However, I didn&apos;t really use Leadership hardly at all (maybe 2 cards, Maria Hill and the one phase buff).  I really cranked the Wakanda Forever engine particularly at the end with Ancestral Knowledge to prime a previous 3 WF move back into the deck,  then Golden City, then Golden City next turn, flip hero and WF three more times.</comments>

						<comments>Jachin and I played standard Rhino again. It was Jachin&apos;s 2nd game.  He played Captain Marvel aggression and I play Iron Man Justice.  We smacked Rhino down.  I eventually did 21 damage with 3 repulsor blasts, powered gauntlet, and two attacks, and Jachin finished him off with energy channel.</comments>

						<comments>Played Standard Rhino with Bomb Scare.  This time I paired up Iron Man with Justice and that worked way better than Aggression.  I was able to handle the threat level better while I got the armor built. It was actually a long battle though, but very satisfying.</comments>
