I had an amazing turn with Nova Force. I can&apos;t count how many cards I was able to play... it was nuts.   One the most fun games I&apos;ve had in a long time on that turn.  Nova can really sing once you get him going.

6HP though.. oof.

Standard Rhino

Put more damage in the kit (Nick Fury and another Turn the Tide).

Could have won in 10 turn if not for Shadows of the Past for clean board.  Finished in about 13, so that&apos;s &quot;better&quot; than 16, 17 turns the last two games.

Standard Rhino + Anachronauts

Ooof. 18 turns win clean board, that was too long. I think it&apos;s my default playstyle creeping back up to me. Maybe played Moon girl too much?

						<comments>Interesting game.  I&apos;m not sure about the whole virtue/corruption mechanic in how that really adds to the game in a fruitful way. Seemed unnecessary.  The main card tableau flow was good with the into play and remove from play affects as the slide across the board.  We got the work placement wrong in the castle.</comments>

						<comments>First time playing the expansion.  It is excellent.

I picked Boba Fett to take on Cade Bane ala Book of Boba Fett.

It was fun playing the Most Feared of the Galaxy ambition.  The extra goals are a nice touch to the game that gives you some direction to shoot for. Kind of like &quot;Prelude&quot; does for Terraforming Mars instead of being completely open-ended 
 It makes for a better feeling of accomplishment ticking off your todo list.  You still have to hit the target fame goal first..

Cool adventure with treasure hunting.  I played with the Elves of Lorien deck which has an interesting mechanic of recurring silvan allies.   Too bad I lost.  I had to lean heavily on Galadriel using her ring to add will to another character when questing just to keep going.  I think part of my mistake was letting the Troll stay too long in the staging area.

						<comments>S1E1 Ebony Maw goes down this time to Ghost Spider with ease.   Getting George Stacey out still feels critical even if was near end game.  Iron Fist is a must in protection for Ebony maw to slow down the spells.  Miles Morales was also helpful with the Stun/Confuse hit.

						<comments>S1E1 Ebony Maw goes down to the might of Nova and his pr-con.  It got tense at the win, but I was able to go in for the finish.  Ms. Marvel came in at just the right time to bounce back Pot Shot for the second time and put him out.

						<comments>First time getting to play this super hyped game.  I can see why it got the hype.  Has the Terraforming Mars vibe too it.

Lots of pieces.

In some ways better, than TM, but also more complicated.  I like the action row just like from Sid Meier&apos;s Civilization New Dawn.  </comments>

Wow! Got a clean board win on S1E1 Ronan in 7 turns!!!

Power Drain set actually helps removing all those encounter cards. The 7 card discard one cleared 2 fanaticism.  Also, help that the first couple of turns saw the removal of about 4 attack cards to thin out his double activations.

S1E1 Ronan  -- got the win and I can&apos;t believe it. Way different deck and Target Acquired was MVP.  I was also able to confuse him more reliably and use to my advantage.  Had to cancel a few treachery cards.  I thought the game was over when I about had my board setup, and I almost quit.  Glad I pushed through.  When I had milano, Eye of Agamotto and Quincarrier out I figured  I had enough resource out for the card draw.  I used Chance encounter to get Nick at the end for the final push.  49 card deck plus the Heavy Cannon which was the offensive MVP of the game to keep whiltting Ronan down 2 damage at a time.  Electro came out twice.

Much better standard end than Ronan.  I kept it fairly under control with the precons although right near the end was going to be nasty.  VG got &quot;We are one&quot; and &quot;Advanced Glider&quot; right as I  took him out.  That would have been rough.

S1E2 

Focused less on Cosmo, still got the win in 8 turns almost clean (2nd stage main).  21 health.

I think my biggest problem is taking Red Skull down in one turn to flip him and taking two encounter cards.</comments>

Took S1E2 Red Skull down in 9 turns, second stag main.  Cosmo got wrecked. I have to rethink this.

Played with the following expansions:

S1E2 

Focused less on Cosmo, still got the win in 8 turns almost clean (2nd stage main).  21 health.

I think my biggest problem is taking Red Skull down in one turn to flip him and taking two encounter cards.</comments>

5 turn win against S1 Zola + Legions of Hydra.  First turn saw the removal of both Legions of Hydra schemes and Shadows of the Past, so I didn&apos;t have to worry too much the rest of the game.

Not a clean board though because bioservants and mutates kept popping out.</comments>

Turn 5 win, but two threat.  It was good that I finished GG off, because he was about to hit me with two facedown boost cards (total of 3 boost cards).  It was a good thing too, because he would have double attacked me almost killing me.</comments>

Vision puts Hela down on a long slugfest to free Odin and make him King again.  Norn stones received.  Beat Ultron twice!

						<comments>Tweak the deck more, and beat S1E1 Hela in Ex campaign.

Helped that Frozen appeared once and SotP didn&apos;t show up at all. Also obligation didn&apos;t hit me.

I put in Stinger as another cheaper ally to get Band Together up more easily.  Captain America because I had Schwarma and got to use him.  I was running four allies a good chunk of the time and Command Center helped as planned especially with Vision and Black Knight.  BK was great for pulling tough off of the big mini boss minions that allowed Valkyrie to clean up with Death Glow combo.

19HP, Odin is King, and Norn Stones really helped Val&apos;s thwart.

I got the win with Valkyrie leadership, but got snapped.  I&apos;m thinking about replaying because I don&apos;t want to go through the rest of the campaign snapped.  Seems tough on Valkyrie if that is the case.

S2 Kang.
Can&apos;t believe I was playing next level Kang villain cards on normal difficulty... the whole time.. .sheesh.

Tried Standard 2.. that was a mistake but accidently had the ex cards in them.  Rough game that went to scheme out with double Dark Dealings.

Black Panther finishes in style by turn 12, clean board 18 Health.

I felt better about this round, but the encounter card was slightly kinder in stage 1.  It could have been worse.

Shadows of the Past going into stage 2 or in stage 2 is not too bad at least with Killmonger.  I like to wound him before going to the last stage that way he&apos;s easy to get out of the way to take on final Kang.

I had a couple of bad turns, but I had enough allies out to help mitigate the damage.

This might be the deck I take to official runs.

Still couldn&apos;t get past Stage 1B with Drax this time. I removed 3 cards, but I don&apos;t think that was the issue.   The advance did me in and nothing I could do.</comments>

S1E1 Kang.  

Black widow putting the kabosh on Turn 15.   I think I could have gone faster. I spent too much time building in Stage 1B when I should have accelerated to Stage 3B to finish building.  I took out Rama tut instead to go on for the win.</comments>

Started out rough with turn 1 Shadows of the Past, but I was able to battle back for the win.

Thankfully turn 1 I got somewhat built enough to not be completely hampered, but it was a slugfest to make it to the end.

It&apos;s definitely a puzzle for Vision because in the intangible form he can&apos;t defend which means potential damage to the tower.  Dense is almost a must unless you have a chump blocker and not pull a boost that damages the tower.

Much better round. It was long though, but Justice prevailed.  Again, not sure why it did better, unless encounter card draws were nice at the start.  I built and took control. Sonic Rifle is nice, but I may need Side Holster.  Also need Ready to Rumble, because Valkyrie needs to ready when flipping to utilize death glow.</comments>

Okay.. got the win.  Took a while, but then it all came together.  Attached Death Glow to Ebony near the end to burn him down in two turns.

Complete domination of S1E1 Ebony Maw campaign. Didn&apos;t even advance to stage 2B!  Never was threaten in thwart.

Beat cop kept it low.  Confused at the right time to flip to Alter-Ego.

So much card draw that it was beautiful.

I think I waited too long honestly.  I need to sprinkle in more Hammer Throws and worry too often about threat. maybe.

						<comments>One more play with Vision precon against S1E1 Klaw + Galactic Artifacts.

Tough game where it got bad early, but Vision was able to battle back and stabilize past all those side schemes.   Unfortunately stupid advance got him.  I would have won had it not happened.  Good test.

						<comments>S1E1 Klaw with Vision Justice running in all Alter-Ego and Galactic artifacts.  had a blast just constantly recurring Vivian with 616 Hickory Branch Lane!  Using Meditation and Reboots to keep things going.  Using Followed/Chance Encounter to damage villain and get allies on side schemes.

Just a ton of fun. Lost to advance late late in the game with 3 accel tokens.

						<comments>Got the win this time with AE Vision and Vivian recursion... just insane.  I added Venom + Sidearm to accelerate the end game with doing 4 damage a turn with Vivian keeping the threat off the main scheme.

S1E1 Klaw goes down with only 1 accel token.  Came close to losing twice with an advance.</comments>

						<comments>S1E1 Klaw can&apos;t handle the might of normal Vision Justice.

Once locked down, Vision went Dense form to finish him off. Starting to like Venom ally even more now that I  have main scheme under control.  Venom really helps speed the game up with his 3 ATK.  Seems perfect for Klaw scenario and other places with 3 health minions too.

Another win against Standard 2 Absorbing Man. 

Quicksilver went a hair slower this time with a rough opening of too many upgrades.  Might have come to finishing in turn 7, but bad villain round slowed me down.

						<comments>Played against standard AI with Naia Sol? The character that allows you to ignore algae costs from the garage... wow! 

I was able to push for the win using algae to get me points on the negotiation board.  However, getting Sleeping Capsules item was key by giving me a point per die at the end of the game (12pts).

						<comments>First solo play and it was a close one. I came up short on wood in round 11.  I  knew I couldn&apos;t make it by the end of the round. I should have save the Mast for last round, because it can add wood to the pile during the action phase (round 12). 

People aren&apos;t joking about the weather die. They&apos;re brutal. That is what cost me the game.  I also should have focused on shelter earlier.</comments>

						<comments>Clay&apos;s first play with another play and my first player.   We both tied, but he got the tiebreaker by having more points on the research track of the temple.   I enjoyed it. I can see why it got a lot of buzz.</comments>

						<comments>Scenario 3 - started over since it ended so quick. 

The forts came out on turn 2!

I did go for destroying forts once I got enough cubes back in the raid pool. Turn 1 was eliminated the opening Rancheros, so a lot of cubes out.  I had to burn my traded goods which I got from the fort :)  I got the enemy morale down to 1.

I took cunning as my starting culture (all of them too), because level 3 is so powerful!  double the actions gained by number of elders during planning.

Now, I have to figure out how to get morale to zero which requires me getting rid of a ranchero before the build anymore. However, I need the cubes back in the pool to increase my chances of that.</comments>

						<comments>I did absymal.  First time playing the Belfaire and Pearlbrook expansions.  Eve just crushed me.  I couldn&apos;t get anything going, but I think I know where I made my mistake.  Either use Owls to get the cards like Courthouse (which I did but didn&apos;t play) or use the Otters as resources.  I think I have come to conclusion that resources trumps card draw.  Other than finding cards you need, what good are cards if you can&apos;t play them.

I do like the expanions.  The Pearlbrook gives more strategic options around the pearls and wonders.   The unique roles area nice addition from Belfaire.

Played with the following expansions:
-Everdell: Bellfaire
-Everdell: Pearlbrook

						<comments>Wow! Found an opportunity to win Scenario 3 after the first historical event.   Take out the Fort for -2 morale after the victory check got them to morale 2.

Took out two Rancheros to make sure I could pass the die roll &gt; 1.

Major Victory.</comments>

						<comments>Scenario 2. got a lucky Major victory only because Narbona&apos;s War came out at just the right time for me to run a Passage of Time and get Enemy Morale to zero. I had built up enough military previous to get me to 8VP during Victory Check.</comments>

						<comments>Stopped after the Francesian&apos;s arrived.  Probably saved my butt temporarily just at the AI queue lined up with &quot;Raids&quot;. They all got swapped with more &quot;peaceful&quot; endeavors for the time being. 

Pueblo revolt was removed after the 3 red cubes were drawn.

Scraping by, but the enemy morale just peaked above my military.</comments>

						<comments>Expert 1 Thanos goes down to the power of Spectrum Justice. It was a long battle. I had too much thwart in the deck.  Even though it helped bursted down high threat, the turns stalled with no ability to do damage. I should have had Turn the Tides and/or Pivotal Moments in there to accelerate damage. I had practically no issues keeping threat down to nothing on main scheme.

						<comments>Expert Thanos win with Spectrum Aggression mulligan. I let one card go by to see how much easier it is to get snapped.  It can happen. One accel token with one threat went into snap on one AE encounter phase.  Thankfully, I was mostly setup, so it didn&apos;t hurt me too bad.

Finished with the Hulk doing the final six damage with the wild card draw!  Also started by flipping Hela to max health after freeing Odin... and we got work done.

						<comments>Okay, able to beat expert Zola this time.  I was able to stabilize and get threat under control enough to get the win.  It took a while, and I wasn&apos;t quite going for the &quot;big finish&quot;, but build up enough ammo counters to keep minions under control. Chasis helped to keep me alive on flips.</comments>

						<comments>Official win of Justice Gamora against standard Hela in campaign.   I had a fairly clean game, but I did have to deal an extra encounter card one time to make sure I did it correct on previous side scheme that I might have forgotten to do.

Really excellent scenario.</comments>

						<comments>Gamora against Standard Thanos.  Great game! I barely beat him before his encounter deck ran out.  I had to push for the end and ignore SuperGiant - Plasma Grenade helped me finish him off with just enough damage...barely.

Then, I saw that I played Sanctuary incorrectly! I&apos;ll have to do it all over again :)

						<comments>Didn&apos;t get to complete my first play of Spectrum against Tower Defense Standard. (Corvious and Proxima).   It started good, but was about to fall apart before I had to leave.  Spectrum is definitely trickier to play trying to time her forms and to get you what you need.

						<comments>Expert Green Goblin Mutagen going down to the mystic might of aggression Scarlet Witch.  Good times.

I realized Combat Training is a waste in Scarlet WItch deck for Aggression. Attack events are the key, just use her to thwart.

						<comments>Got the win on novice. Implemented the strategy from another user and a variant from yet another user. Focus on cards and MC and green cards early.   I got a lot of card draw eventually that helped a lot.

Variant: Dummy player has to leave their card always, so shuffle twice after each round.  Once with card left behind at end of round, then second next turn when card goes into deck.

						<comments>Mission 2 of the 1st Solo Campaign

-2 points.
LMG and 2 Rifles escaped
Captured wagon and control marker (artillery)
Capture truck
Card in hand - Marked Spent( Battlefield Confusion)
2 bunkers destroyed

Felt like a pyrrhic victory sacrificing those pioneers to destroy those bunkers.  I wonder if it was better just to get out of dodge asap.

Captured wagon and control marker (artillery)
Capture truck
Card in hand - Marked Spent( Battlefield Confusion)
2 bunkers destroyed

Felt like a pyrrhic victory sacrificing those pioneers to destroy those bunkers.  I wonder if it was better just to get out of dodge asap.

Went fairly well.  I was able to destroy all the Aircraft Factories to keep the supply low.  Lost Commander Lemay on one mission.  No reassignments. I paid the 12 SO to help out Med Theater and not lose an aircraft.</comments>

						<comments>Finished the short month of December (2 weeks), and was able to nicely take down 14 points of Airfields and Aircraft Factory. I think I was around 28/10 AF points.

Evaluation was good 56 pts! I&apos;m glad I counted the cards though, because I somehow screwed up the total.. way off and too low.   I did remember to include 4 UBoat VPs.

7 Airfields
7 Aircraft Factories
3 Transportation Factories
2 U-Boats</comments>

						<comments>Got through my first month on a four month campaign.  Wow!  This is epic!  More involved than TAL, but I&apos;m engrossed.  Not sure I can quantify it.  Having a blast and still learning the rules.  3 more months to go I think. First month went okay.  I fudged  afew rolls because I&apos;m learning, so I expect it to be more harsh this next month as I get more &quot;honest&quot; with the rolls.  I&apos;ll have to focus on the secondary objective more and maybe take out one aircraft factory.  Got to decide if I&apos;m going to bring another bomber.</comments>

Generalist fed the Scientist Samples who focused on the cures. Containment Specialist went around getting dice bag into the bag with his special ability.

						<comments>Starting to grok the game. Put an asterisk on the win because I fudged a couple of rolls.   Anyway, it&apos;s vital you exavacate ASAP even at the expense of a couple of hits to your base. Being able to free up dice allocation is key, plus you do need t hose three research spaces to hit the goal.</comments>

						<comments>Why do I not play this more often?!?!?!?!  Such a good game.

Potent win using &quot;Dex&quot;.  I keep forgetting how useful holding 2 cards back can be.  If anything, I could generate a leadership command more easily if those two extra cards aren&apos;t useful.

I beat Viking with Shattered Glass, Dreams of Salvation, and Program Shift.  Easier than I thought it would be but still quite a bit of brain burn to get there.

						<comments>Squeaked out a win when I realized I didn&apos;t need the abort because my lady Troll could finish off the last two obstacles after my human mage/face went critical via exhaust token. 

I found healing my runner (human) 1HP was enough to help out, since he got to draw two cards right away on his turn from being staggered and could play them.

I&apos;m liking Press the Advantage more now that I understand the wording. Being able to cycle the deck seems helpful to get your purchased market cards back into your deck.</comments>

						<comments>First game.. Rough. I felt like there was no way to win an introductory scenario. I picked the Dwarf and a Human.  Human was my thief/mage and Dwarf was Hacker/Fighter (samurai).

I barely made it past the first scene only to get hammered in the second round.  I did play the crossfire incorrectly.  Still too many hard obstacles.</comments>

						<comments>Okay.. second round went much better.  I picked a beefier partner in the Troll with 7 HP and slightly better starting hand size than the dwarf - 3 vs 2.  Also, drew much easier obstacles only doing 1 damage a round... phew.  

However, Aerial combat drone was super nasty and took a while to take down.  

Human mage finished it up with an epic turn where the Crossfire actually helped out by getting me a Market card that let me play another market card. I gave the normal obstacle to the Troll since she went last.  I figured it would give me enough time to finish things off with the Troll after the Human went first.  Lightning bolt played from the market with the win. No need for troll to intervene. Much better round.</comments>

						<comments>Tried my build tri-sphere deck against scenario one of Khazad-dum &quot;Into the Pit&quot;.  Had a good opening hand, but everything fell apart once we hit the bridge.  Enemies hit hard, and the stupid patrol leader that can cancel damage if a enemy is drawn on his response! Ugh.

						<comments>Tried my build tri-sphere deck against scenario one of Khazad-dum &quot;Into the Pit&quot;.  Had a good opening hand, but everything fell apart once we hit the bridge.  Enemies hit hard, and the stupid patrol leader that can cancel damage if a enemy is drawn on his response! Ugh.

						<comments>Good first game.   I didn&apos;t play well after one bad decision to get rid of what turned out to be the easier secret object, but I started out well.  Jachin came very close to winning.

						<comments>First go at this.  oooff... Really tough to get that research up there. I think I focused too much on shooting down enemy ships instead of research, but it&apos;s hard until you get more excavated.  I also played excavation wrong.  It was fun brain burny puzzle each round.  Very clever.</comments>

						<comments>Got my first win at Novice!  Still have a hard time seeing how you can win at higher levels.  You&apos;d have to be very lucky to get that starting engine going.   Last round becomes more action/production focused.  Tharsis Republic&apos;s ability to draw extra and keep extra cards was very handy.</comments>

						<comments>Didn&apos;t finish because I had to pick up Jachin.  Mostly a learning game where I definitely made some mistakes.  Still not 100% positive I was doing the bot correctly, but at least I got better and faster with it.  It plays fairly smooth as you start to learn the keywords.  Didn&apos;t feel like a &apos;civ&apos; game, but just a cool deckbuilder with interesting decisions.</comments>

						<comments>Took the same crafted deck in easy mode with Tournament.

Crushed it with the horse on Glorfindel.  The horse kept knocking out locations left and right as they came into play. it wasn&apos;t fair.   I can see why people consider this the least interesting scenario. It would still be more difficult on Normal without the starting resource.

Played with the following expansions:
-The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game – The Hills of Emyn Muil

						<comments>Played Easy Mode + unofficial Enjoyment Mode with Lore Aragorn, Spirit Glorfindel, and Leadership Gloin. My first three sphere deck on The Hills of Emyn Muil.  

Actually got the win.  It got a hairy at one point and lost my Sword of Broken which was almost &quot;broken&quot; on Aragorn with the extra will power.  It certainly helped.

Light of Valinor attached to Glorfindel helped with him committing to the quest and not taking threat.  Asfaloth came in late and was amazing to take the finishing adding two progress to any location with Glorfindel riding it.

						<comments>Tough fight, but Basic Groot prevailed against expert Kang + Anachronauts.

First stage was easy. Second stage was lost super quick.  Third stage was a knock down drag out fight twice coming 1 threat away from loss and lots of minions.

I did miss the stupid future weapon and had to resolve it the turn after.  I hope that okay. The rest was clean.

Played with the following expansions:

						<comments>Calling this one a win because I was one turn away and played the high stakes.  I gave myself the mulligan at the end to beat expert Kang + Anachronauts.  Basic Drax worked fairly well, but I had to be super careful about the threat.  Actually didn&apos;t go through the encounter deck until near the end, so Drax got work done with the Knife Leaps and Fight Me Coward. Helped one shot-ing tough minoins with guard out of the way as well.</comments>

						<comments>Tough game against Expert Kang. Thought I was going to lose one time when Depowered had Spiderwoman locked down.  Flipped to Alter-ego and barely survived.... 

Lost second stage, but I was mostly built by then. I think I lost Avengers Mansion twice to Time Travel Hijinks before that.

Cleared the minions at the start of stage 3 because I was in alter-ego.  After that, just worked him down.

						<comments>Expert Kang gets the win against Gamora Basic. I was using most of the Venom basic deck, but took out the Pulse Grenades and Gamora ally, added Endurance and another Hit and Run plus Asses the SItuation.

It was toughter. First stage went fast, but got bogged down in stage 2.  I couldn&apos;t quite get everything setup board wise, because of trying to stabilize, recover, get threat down.  It&apos;s harder without confusion to give time to recover since he schemes for so much.  Lost due to scheme on an Advance... technically twice because I played on

						<comments>Basic Gamora putting the beat down on Expert Kang.  I tweaked the deck by adding another Assess the Situation and put in Ironheart to make up for loss Gamora ally from Basic Venom Deck.  I figured she could use more card draw since she doesn&apos;t have spider sense.  First stage was tough, but I perserved.  Second stage was tricky as well. I decided to let him scheme out into Stage 3 because I was mostly setup.   Burned him down in 2 turns in Stage 3.

						<comments>Basic Gamora putting the beat down on Expert Kang.  I tweaked the deck by adding another Assess the Situation and put in Ironheart to make up for loss Gamora ally from Basic Venom Deck.  I figured she could use more card draw since she doesn&apos;t have spider sense.  First stage was tough, but I perserved.  Second stage was tricky as well. I decided to let him scheme out into Stage 3 because I was mostly setup.   Burned him down in 2 turns in Stage 3.

						<comments>Putting Expert Kang w/ Anachronauts down with relative ease using a few leadership cards.  Still a good chunk basic.  Added Yondu who never got played. Drax was more MVP especially Inspired + Laser Blaster for one round.  He probably doled out 20+ damage over the course of the game.  Welcome Aboard is nice in Guardian Leadership.

						<comments>Loss to threat although I might have played a rule wrong on the Sentinels. I added too much threat possibly ending the game sooner.  It felt a little railroaded with the starting plot recommendation.  Pretty much with two heroes keep going to the same mission every time until first story card is complete.  Then there is choice and the threat pressure is massive. I had to get to the showdown ASAP, but threat overtook me just as I was able to get past the mission to activate it.</comments>

						<comments>Expert Kang going down to Venom&apos;s protection over the Guardians.  It took a while to stabilize and first round was rough.  Of course Shadows of the Past comes out eventually.  What was frustrating was how many times I needed to Run and Gun and &quot;Depowered&quot; showed up at the wrong time.

I chose wisely to eventually lose the second stage which turned out for the best because I could handled Depowered yet again in alter ego (start of turn).  I had to use Run and Gun to blow away minions at the start of villain stage 3.

						<comments>Another beat down of Standard Klaw with Gamora Leadership.  Definitely had too many attachments and didn&apos;t use a single one.  Team Training didn&apos;t get into play not for lack of trying being in hand on turn one, just got overruled by Avengers Mansion and Keen Instincts.  Used Get Ready once, but the rest was my allies and hero kit and Knowhere.  Triskelion didn&apos;t get played because I already had knowhere down, so it was less a priority.  I did get up to four allies and came close to a fifth.  Not sure how well the deck would have worked against expert Klaw though because of the clogging up of attachments.   Main scheme stayed on stage 1, but would have definitely gone to stage 2 with Klaw on expert (Stage 3).

						<comments>Another beat down of Standard Klaw with Gamora Leadership.  Definitely had too many attachments and didn&apos;t use a single one.

						<comments>Scenario 3 of Over Hill and Under Hill.   That was rough. Lost bilbo to the riddles :( Jachin was not happy.  I hope I can get him to play it again.  I&apos;m going to have to get some AP&apos;s to help out, so we can retool the decks.

						<comments>Wasn&apos;t sure I would beat expert Klaw and Groot Justice.  At one point I had three armored guards in play not sure how I would get them eliminated it.  It took quite a while to stabilize, then I had to rush to finish Klaw with 3 accel tokens on the board.  I finished with a great array of allies (Drax, Rocket, Cosmo, Agent Coulson) and  &quot;I AM GROOT&quot; beat down for 9 damage.

						<comments>Rocket Raccoon getting the drop on Expert Kang with Protection. I focused more on letting allies defend like Groot or getting tough status cards with Perserverance and Muster Courage.  I think that worked out well. I used Energy Barriers as well to help fuel the tech drop.

						<comments>Very tough loss for Rocket Raccoon Leadership against Expert Kang.  I would have had him two turns later after he schemed out on me. It was a epic game too where twice the Masters of Evil side scheme came out and loaded up the minions and got me to 2 accel tokens too fast.

						<comments>Very tough loss for Rocket Raccoon Leadership against Expert Kang.  I would have had him two turns later after he schemed out on me. It was a epic game too where twice the Masters of Evil side scheme came out and loaded up the minions and got me to 2 accel tokens too fast. I thought for sure I would lose after a boat of minions came out, but I was able to work them down surprising. I learned the value of reload and flora &amp; fauna.</comments>

						<comments>Couldn&apos;t quite get the Leadership as a resource engine going for Drax against expert Klaw.  I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s the right way to build for him.  The resource part works against Drax getting card draw with &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; because the allies are exhausted before they can thwart. I can only run 3 Get Readys. Maybe more Skycycles with more avengers?

						<comments>Defeated expert Klaw with a crazy Cosmo+Enraged+Boot Camp build where the dog was doing 5 ATK damage and not taking consequential damage.  All Cosmo has to do to not take damage is for you to name &quot;Event&quot; and look at the Invocation deck of Dr. Strange and it&apos;s easy money.

						<comments>Okay. win against standard Klaw.  I trashed some cards of Drax&apos;s pre-con. He needed more thwart, so in goes 3 Hard to Ignore from GMW box (Groots pre-con)... that worked great! I add Knowhere and Groot and Desparate Defense along with Power in All of us and Power of Protection.

Worked way better. It was a great game that showcased Drax&apos;s power. I kept in hero form the whole game and once you get 3 vengeance counters on him, he sings!</comments>

						<comments>Got expert Kang this time.  I think I like this Scarlet Witch deck. I still think I maybe moving too slow or have too much support in the deck.  Martial Prowess does get used but maybe not as much as I want.  Helps with Molecular Decay at the end. I had a 21 HP finish for the win. I did purposely lose the second stage to go in fighting on the third stage of Kang.</comments>

						<comments>Got expert Kang this time.  I think I like this Scarlet Witch deck. I still think I maybe moving too slow or have too much support in the deck.  Martial Prowess does get used but maybe not as much as I want.  Helps with Molecular Decay at the end. I had a 21 HP finish for the win. I did purposely lose the second stage to go in fighting on the third stage of Kang.</comments>

						<comments>Tough loss to Expert Kang, but I was working him on 3rd stage.   Just too many acceleration tokens and got locked up. Threat loss. I think the deck was too thick.

						<comments>After thinning my deck down to 40 cards with 3 spiritual medidation and 3 plan of attacks... wow! I almost coasted through expert Kang.  I did lose the second stage due to threat, but that actually worked in my favor.   Losing the second stage of Kang makes it easier to go into stage 3, because you get first crack at Kang and your nemesis.  I was also built up by then as well.</comments>

						<comments>Wow.  Tough game on third scenario of core set.  Legolas was captured which hurt my deck tremendously.  Jachin was card restrained and resource heavy, and I was resource constrained and ally heavy.  

I was unfortunately eliminated by threat after an Ungoliath Spawn shot my threat up by 8, so I wasn&apos;t able to stick around long enough.

Jachin finished the game with a win though. His deck opened way up as soon as he started drawing allies particularly dwarf ones.</comments>

						<comments>Tried the first scenario and we stopped as soon as we realized that we couldn&apos;t take the first stage super fast. We needed time to build up before getting to the Trolls.  There was no way we could defeat them with what we had.

						<comments>Wow. Scenario one of Hobbit 2nd try.  Brilliant game and a brilliant win.  We both had to really work together to make some plans on how take these trolls out.  Getting Gandalf out of Jachin&apos;s discard pile was key using my spirit card.  We had to time everything right and I had to get Blade of Gondolin down on the go before trolls and use feint to damage Tom before he attack. We then used Gandalf by reading him twice more to attack Tom after the troll&apos;s attack to eliminate him in the first go around.  

Unfortunately we took a 6 threat hit on the next turn because the sacks kept us from questing enough characters to keep the thwart down. Gimli and Legolas helped get progress made though with their destruction of the next troll. 

It took us a while to figure out how to finish the Troll Cave to get the treasures, but we worked in time and got William in last go around before Jachin&apos;s threat got out of control (48).

We were so relieved that Stage 3 meant we won with the Trolls dead in stage two.  We got the treasure!!!!!!!!!!!!!</comments>

						<comments>Fudged win against expert Kang and Ms. Marvel Justice.  I forgot to add the standard/expert cards and did until late in the game then flubbed a card. I&apos;ll asterisk it, but it was fun.  Ms. Marvel is quite potent especially when you get the board built out. Having Helicarrier and Skilled Investigator as sacrificial lambs was helpful to keep more important cards in play.

						<comments>Again. another threat loss.  I got to second stage of the second core set scenario.  Went card dry and threated out a gain. That Cave Troll is rough sticking around to two rounds.  I can&apos;t quest enough in the early game to keep the threat down because of that Troll.  My starting threat is too high which makes it engage right away.</comments>

						<comments>I played scenario one again single deck with the correct rules.  Jachin&apos;s deck was so slow with high threat.  I miraculously got the win on the last turn where I was going to lose due to threat.  I was able to pull out the Ungoliant Spawn because I picked the correct path that let me fetch it, and bam... win.</comments>

						<comments>Played the second core set scenario on Easy Mode.  Got the win with our custom decks.  I was running Lore/Tactics with cards from Hobbit saga expansion and Jachin ran Leadership/Spirit..   It was probably too easy for our decks.</comments>

						<comments>Played two-handed my first game to get a feel for the rules. I played the starter Leadership and Tactics deck on the starter scenario A Passage through Mirkwood.   I think I got most of the rules correct and it was a glorious finish as the end intensified.  Gimli and Beorn were able to easily bring down Ungoliant&apos;s Spawn on the first round.  I need to double Grim Resolve to see if it truly readies the entire board of characters in play and whether Legolas only adds progress to the quest and not location (cause if this is true..

						<comments>Beat Expert Kang with Aggression Scarlet Witch.  That was very nice.  First stage was rough staying ahead of him.  It took me forever to get to the point I could start dealing damage to him and I thought I would lose to threat a couple of times.

						<comments>Oh yeah, this was the epic win against Expert Red Skull I was looking forward to see.  Just as things were about to look grim with RS putting 10 threat (almost a loss) on the main scheme and pull out more side schemes.  I pulled the epic finish.  I had 10 cards in hand at the start of my turn.  Avengers Mansion to go to 11 cards.  Play two cards to put Maria Hill in play and draw two cards with her and Knowhere! Back to 11.  I had 3 Sliding Shots in my hand!  Red Skull had tough and 15 HP (and retaliate). Star Lord was at 4 HP. I had two Gutsy Moves in hand!  Four allies down on the board!

Guess what I cleared the board of threat, played Iron Heart, and drew a third Gutsy Move and cycled my deck!  I had hit him for 13 HP right before that, but then I was doing 17 HP of damage with a sliding shot to take him out and enough cards to play another 17 HP sliding shot!</comments>

						<comments>Took on expert Taskmaster with Star Lord Leadership.  Pretty easy and  got all the captives freed before finishing the first round of encounter deck.  I held on longer to clean up the place instead of going for the kill.

						<comments>Very close loss against Expert Red Skull.  The deck was just starting to stabilize and I was probably one turn away from turning the corner, but he schemed for 9 threat!!!! Just enough to lose.  Boy, I miss Under Surveilance.

						<comments>Okay correct milano upgrade this time.  I took out Standard Ronan using the optional rule not to include the Kree Supremacy and my own variant to start with Milano upgrades.  It was no cakewalk still, but I barely made. He advanced to second stage very fast.  It was hard dealing with the power stone to remove threat and get rid of Cut the Power.  Thankfully, the Universal Weapon stayed buried in the encounter deck until the very last round which I survived because I had him stunned!!!  I&apos;m not sure I would have survived at 6 HP if he drew another attack with the universal weapon and getting an extra boost card.</comments>

I swapped starting boards and then things slowly fell into place for the W.  Good play. Tough game. I won by eliminated on the cities in threat level 3.  I was about two cards away from fear victory and two cards into level 3 invader cards.</comments>

						<comments>Standard Drang going down to the blade of Gamora Aggression with a Decisive Blow. Epic. She had him mostly under control and kept the threat down most of the time.  Had one turn that almost advanced to stage 2, but didn&apos;t. That was the next turn where I cleaned up. 10 HP, got the Badoon Blitz and the Badoon Headhunter for maximum points to take to the Market.

						<comments>Standard Collector Infiltrate the Museum going down to Gamora. A little tougher, I technically won then tried to push farther to see if I could get more out of the collection but it was too difficult, so I stopped for 2 victory points :(  Really hard to get the collection down to 1 and threat to zero.

						<comments>Standard Collector Escape the Museum goes down to Gamora. 3 VP (took two artifacts - egg and teapot).  I took my time during stage 2 of the main scheme to build up for the big push to the end.  Nemesis came out though to slow it down more.  Quick push to the end and the win.</comments>

						<comments>This time going against standard Ultron went much better.  Getting Gamora&apos;s Sword down is critical for managing drones.  Her ability pop a damage when a thwart event is played helps, but couple with the sword and she&apos;s dealing another damage to a drone on an attack event.  </comments>

						<comments>Tough battle against Expert Ultron.  I think Gamora&apos;s pre-con can still take expert Ultron, but I just couldn&apos;t pull it together after a bad turn.

						<comments>This time going against standard Ultron went much better.  Getting Gamora&apos;s Sword down is critical for managing drones.  Her ability pop a damage when a thwart event is played helps, but couple with the sword and she&apos;s dealing another damage to a drone on an attack event.  </comments>

						<comments>Gamora ROCKED standard Collector Escape the Museum with her pre-con deck. I was very impressed.  Conditioning Room is very nice. It acts like an avengers mansion keyed on her attack/thwart events but also heals her in alter-ego.

						<comments>Another Gamora win pre-con against standard Collector Escape the Museum.  It was a tougher game, because it took me a while to get Keen Instincts and Conditioning Room down. I even went through my deck once.  I had a very bad villain phase that pulled out a lot of minions, but I was able to work them down over two rounds. </comments>

						<comments>Yes, this time Quicksilver does the standard Collector Escape the Museum this time. It took much longer and I was in stage 2 for a LONG time setting up.  However, when I was ready, I hit the afterburners to remove 12 threat for the win and burned through stage 3 in one go.  4 threat was left on stage 2, and QS was bumped up to 3 THW per action and then I added Maximum Velocity to 5 THW per action.   This is the way to win it if you want to be prepared to finish off the Collector and not waste time dealing with the Collector&apos;s ship hitting you every villain phase.</comments>

						<comments>Quicksilver Justice against Standard Collector Escape the Museum.  Epic payback with a 3 turn win was quite impressive. It helped getting Hyper Velocity down for the extra thwart (4 thw a turn).  I also took two encounter cards to get rid of 10 threat for speed things up.

						<comments>Testing a new solo challenge against standard Zola. This was inspired by Steve Kimmell&apos;s overkill challenge/achievement using Rocket Raccoon against Zola.

I was using Wasp this time. This was a loss because of threat.

-Marvel Champions: The Card Game – Wasp Hero Pack

						<comments>Alright, I survived better with Wasp this time against Standard Zola and killing him with overkill only.  Good game. It took a while, but we got there.  Had some very close calls especially due to scheming.</comments>

						<comments>One rule tweak. Milano upgrades are permanent setup at the start of Standard Ronan campaign encounter.  Finally, I got the win, but it was not easy at all. One of the toughest battles I faced, but this feels more balanced.  It came down to the wire. Ronan at 1HP, and I had 2 HP.  I had to survive one more encounter with him hitting for 5ATK plus overkill and the environment that does 1 damage at the end of the villain phase.  I survived with no damage because of Armored plating and got the win.  These feels like a more balanced rule tweak for solo campaign.</comments>

						<comments>Interesting game. I&apos;m glad I got to play it after hearing so much about it. I&apos;d definitely play it again. I like the uniqueness of the factions. I played the Kjas faction which wants to put down this territory tiles for points and needs the colonies to do that.</comments>

						<comments>Another interesting game that feels like it wants to be a semi-coop, but it isn&apos;t. I guess it could be meaner in the way you place enemy units, but we were too nice. I crushed it hard.  I had some amazing rolls on getting exploding dice on a d4 to take out some tough enemies that set me up for the win.</comments>

It was a loose win because I did make some rules goofs, so the enemy would have been much tougher gains aember faster.</comments>

						<comments>Much better round with Groot Protection against expert Klaw.  It took a long time to get him down.  At one point, things were looking grim when there six minions on the board, and I was fighting to stay afloat.  Three of those minions were armored guards and two where beefy masters of evil.  It took a while to get them chipped away.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this match went 1.5 to 2 hours to finally beat him down. I didn&apos;t waste any resources getting rid of his attachmments.</comments>

						<comments>Epic! Epic game against Expert Kang and Rocket Aggression! Wow! Lots of lows to fight through for the eventual win! I did lose the 2nd stage not without trying.  I fought hard, but I was struggling to stabilize just as I was making progress on stage 2.  I found out it&apos;s not as painful ending stage 2 on the villain phase (scheme out), because I get my turn after that at the start of stage 3.  It was still a tough battle to get stable when I had to flip to almost recover and then get threat back down.  It&apos;s tough in aggression even with Rocket&apos;s high thwart capacity.  I had a blast though getting that win finally.

						<comments>Tentative Victory against Standard Ronan.  I had to replay the first villain phase again because I misdealt encounter cards.  I may dealt one less another time though so I can&apos;t call it a clean win plus I might have missed the Pincer maneuver side scheme.

						<comments>Cleaner game against Standard Ronan.  He schemed out, but I lasted much longer by getting the Universal Weapon and Kree Supremacy out of play turn one.  Yes, I had to take four encounter cards still, but that universal weapon gone also makes a big difference.  You can now confuse and stun Ronan if necessary plus less atk and sch.</comments>

						<comments>Second go around with Standard Nebula went better.  Ant-Man justice got her down before the player deck ran out and just as the encounter deck ran out. I read the rules better in that I was handling the attachments wrong and did do the evasion counter removal correctly the first time.  It wasn&apos;t easy, and I tad lucky with Shadows of the Past going away on the opening draw and so few minions coming out.

						<comments>Standard Ronan... Ant-Man Justice.  Got beat down in turn 3, and I think I would have died in turn two because I forgot about all those stupid encounter cards.  You start out with four encounter cards in the villain phase!!!! Stupid Pincer Manuever is a second side scheme added to the mix for campaign with a wonky threat addition if you did well with evasions counters in the previous scenario. Ugh.

Spent all my units for a 4 cost card by the way. I got the armor plating to help with the beat down.  Never came out and none of the Milano upgrades came out.</comments>

						<comments>Up against Standard Collector Escape the Museum. Note to self, don&apos;t take so many encounter cards with the Library action. It&apos;s tempting, but use it sparingly sheesh.   Tough loss.

						<comments>Did much better this time against Standard Collector Escape the Museum.  I focused more on natural thwart abilities and didn&apos;t try to get the standard challenge side scheme until the end instead of at the beginning.  I used Hyper Thrusters to good use and got the Milano out in turn one. That worked much better.  Hyper Thrusters kept whittling down the side scheme threat while working the main scheme.  

Down to 1 HP when I finished.  4 Units and spent all four to get the Heavy Cannon for Milano.</comments>

						<comments>Aggression Ant-Man against Standard Drang in the campaign setting.  Fun challenge.  The Badoon minions definitely add some annoying twists.  I did get the headhunter for 2 victory points.  I think my total is 4.  It took a little while, but I got the victory.  Double Hand Cannons were nice when I got to use them, but too many times I had to defend so didn&apos;t use them as much.  Follow Through unfortunately never got put down at all because of prioritizing over Ant-man upgrades, so I didn&apos;t get amazing overkills.

						<comments>Justice Ant-man makes it in to the museum against Standard Collector - Infiltrate the Museum.  Oh boy it was HARD! I can&apos;t image this on expert where he gets to start with two of your cards in the collection.  Plus, how many cards you going to lose out of your expert deck for the rest of the campaign!!!

I tried hard to minimize the allies in play. Wiccan was a MVP putting out damage with thwart.  Those Galactic Artifacts are just nasty.  I wish that you could free up more cards from the collection beyond one per round.

						<comments>First play with Rocket Raccoon against Standard Green Goblin Mutagen.  Very enjoyable with his pre-con aggression deck.  He&apos;s potent solo because he can thwart very well and do great damage.  Having minions helps since some of his cards keys off a minions . The only challenge is keeping track of restricted weapons.

						<comments>First play with Groot pre-con protection against Standard Green Goblin Mutagen.  He&apos;s a lot harder to pilot then Rocket because he doesn&apos;t have consistent good thwart.  He can put out the damage though with Fighting Fit, I AM GROOT, and Root Stomp cards.  Now, we can do some major thwart at times, but he gets behind between rounds too easily.  Needs more allies to help with thwart.</comments>

						<comments>First play with Rocket Raccoon against Standard Green Goblin Mutagen.  Very enjoyable with his pre-con aggression deck.  He&apos;s potent solo because he can thwart very well and do great damage.  Having minions helps since some of his cards keys off a minions . The only challenge is keeping track of restricted weapons.

						<comments>First play with Groot pre-con protection against Standard Green Goblin Mutagen.  He&apos;s a lot harder to pilot then Rocket because he doesn&apos;t have consistent good thwart.  He can put out the damage though with Fighting Fit, I AM GROOT, and Root Stomp cards.  Now, we can do some major thwart at times, but he gets behind between rounds too easily.  Needs more allies to help with thwart.</comments>

						<comments>Epic win against Expert Ultron.  I thought I had lost after spending almost everything I had with two hammer throws and Janborn to get Ultron down to 3 health (had to take out two drones to do it with him in Stage 3).  As I was bout to except defeat with Ultron ready to scheme out for the win in the last stage, I realized I had one shot by going alter-ego and using Hall of Heroes.  I flipped and drew Wasp! I had enough energy to put her in place to punch Ultron down for the win!

						<comments>* Asterisk win against Expert Zola because I did one cheat on a draw because I was doing well and I want to see what happened if I had reversed order of cards.  It turned in a long brutal battle of a win. I thinned my deck way down and I think it did better overall.  I had Spiritual Mediation which I didn&apos;t count as my deck size given the fact that the cards replace themselves as a filter, so even though I had 43 cards, I treated it as 40.</comments>

						<comments>Expert Ultron, one turn beat down was unreal!  I can&apos;t remember the last time I&apos;ve seen something like that happen.  I guess it&apos;s really important to have blockers more than I realized.

						<comments>Took down expert Klaw with Antman Justice.  It worked really well and felt almost too easy. i didn&apos;t need the Beat Cops, and I wonder if I put more Lay down the Law and Running interference if that might have been better. I did use Crisis Averted once to get the threat way down.

						<comments>&quot;Grey&quot; Hulk taking on expert Ultron with nothing but basic cards.   It was a very close and tough game even with a near perfect opening first turn.  I was get both Avengers Mansion and Immovable Object down on turn 1.  If I had one more turn, I might have beaten Ultron... maybe, but the threat was too much to handle.  Also getting exhausted by that stupid expert card came at a bad time.

						<comments>I&apos;ll have to asterisk this win, Standard Ultron, because I did cheat a tad to see how things play out.  This was standard difficulty this time and it took a while for Avengers Mansion and Immovable object to show up that slowed way down and seems more typical of a normal game.  I think this might make a good solo challenge.  I don&apos;t know how players will play this without Beat &apos;em up (wasp pack?).</comments>

						<comments>Putting expert Zola down with a webbed-up and double swinging web kick! 13 HP left, no minions in play, and Black Cat freed from Hydra Prison for an improved thwart upgrade.

I almost feel like Spiderman is too easy in this campaign, because Aunt May can heal him up real quick.

Invalid game because I put incorrect amount of threat at the start.

Bad loss though.  Sleeper on first turn.  Nemesis on third turn with many minions already coming out... ugh.

Much better round this time with correct threat at the start.  Aunt May came out on the first round which took forever the first round.  I never missed her so much.

Turn the Tide was very effective.  Got the board built out and took Red Skull down.</comments>

						<comments>Spiderman justice prevails over expert Taskmaster. I sprinkled in the Concussive Blows and Skilled Investigator in place of Turn the Tides.  I figured I need to maximize my time on getting more encounter cards than doing damage.  I may rethink this going into Red Skull where I want more damage. Same for Zola.

12 HP and 3 captives freed: Moon Knight, White Tiger, and Elektra.   When I saw I missed my opportunity to get Shang Chi early in the second round of the encounter deck, I decided to finish off Taskmaster in good fashion.  I didn&apos;t want to play another hour to cycle the encounter deck.</comments>

						<comments>Got expert Crossbones this time.  Seemed like most cards fell into my hand at the right time a lot.  Epic feel.  Even with Madame Hydra coming out at the end, I was able to finish off Crossbones with yet another Swinging Web Kick.  I was able to cancel a Full Auto with Spider Sense right before that turn where I would have taken heavy damage.

13HP, only two experimental weapons in the deck because of Under Surveillance kept him at the first stage.   Taking Tactical Scanner.</comments>

						<comments>Played  both heroes: Protection Quicksilver and Justice Scarlet Witch against expert Green Goblin Mutagen Formula.  Man, long game, but I prevailed.  I think I could have been a tad more aggressive earlier.  However, it is still good to handle minions in the second stage of the villain scheme since threat goes up by the number of goblins in play.

I did make mistakes playing the signature allies when I should not have. I corrected one mistake though.

						<comments>Great win against standard Taskmaster in the Excelsior challenge (Alter Ego only).  Black Widow I think did a better job than  She-hulk.  Of course the first five or six turns were tough getting established and keeping threat down.  Once all beat cops were in play, then I rest way easier.  Black Widow has the advantage over a lot of heroes in that she can confuse the villain and remove 4 threat (Covert Ops) in alter-ego mode.  This is key to freeing captives too.  Also, she has a lot of prep cards that even though that don&apos;t function in alter-ego mode, they thin your deck way down so you&apos;re cycling Cover Opts, allies, counterintelligence, spycraft, and espionages.

Of course the first five or six turns were tough getting established and keeping threat down.  Once all beat cops were in play, then I rest way easier.  Black Widow has the advantage over a lot of heroes in that she can confuse the villain and remove 4 threat (Covert Ops) in alter-ego mode.  This is key to freeing captives too.  Also, she has a lot of prep cards that even though that don&apos;t function in alter-ego mode, they thin your deck way down so you&apos;re cycling Cover Opts, allies, counterintelligence, spycraft, and espionages.

						<comments>Tougher match against expert Rhino this time.  I came close to losing and it was all down to the last turn where I had to take him out or lose.  Of course, he had a Hydra Soldier to guard him... grrr.  I had to take out both, but I was able to plan out my hand to take care of it all which was sweet.  Swift Retribution put him down.

						<comments>Iron Man/Justice prevails over expert Red Skull.  It wasn&apos;t too bad of a round and was mostly domination.  Supersonic punch for the finishing move. I even forgot to use Tactical Scanner.

						<comments>Better win against expert Zola and Iron Man/Justice.  It helped getting Under Surveillance early, so I was more comfortable flipping back and forth while ignoring Zola most of the game.  It was a long game, because I waited to get my board built up and then wanted to make no minions were in play before finishing off Zola.  I didn&apos;t want another potential five encounter card round with Red Skull next game.   Finished with 13 HP and rescued War Machine for the Improved thwart upgrade.</comments>

						<comments>First play of Scarlet Witch. I used her pre-con deck against Rhino.  Wow! She&apos;s cray good. I&apos;m not sure I really broke a sweat with her.  She has some crazy good thwart and great allies.  I love her &apos;Turn the Tide&quot; card to do 3 damage after clearing thwart from a scheme which can stack for multiple attacks on different enemies or the same.  She doesn&apos;t have a lot of support, but what little she has is great.  Spiritual Meditation is great for crafting your hand and combine that with Agatha Harkness!

Anyway.. easy win.

						<comments>Tough loss with Iron Man Leadership against expert Crossbones. Everything got thrown at me and I just could not keep up. I was using allies as resources which meant getting behind on minions to some degree.  I did get all the armor out, but boy was it tough getting there.  Legions of Hydra came out. Whiplash came out! Threat finally got me.   I&apos;ll have to rethink my strategy, because threat management is a big problem until you can get your hand size up to a decent level.

						<comments>Finally took care of expert Crossbones with cheap ally as resources Leadership strategy.  I think the key to victory was Legions of Hydra NOT showing up nor Shadows of the past.

						<comments>Expert Red Skull easily controlled for a win. It was a long game, but I did well considering it was going to be a rough start.  It started on 2nd main scheme stage plus three extra encounter cards and two sides which made for two more drawn encounter cards (5 encounter cards for 1st villain phase). I burned that tactical scanner thin and there to get up to 11 cards for building the board.   Came close to losing to threat once the villain phase right after I played Under Surveillance for 13 threat!!

						<comments>Took down expert Zola with Protection!  Shocked.  It took a while and it got really nasty with minions partly because of bad draws.  But.. BP prevailed.  13HP, 2 minions left and Shuri freed for Improved Thwart Upgrade.

						<comments>Expert Taskmaster too easy. Black Panther Justice prevails without really breaking a sweat.  First time using Sense of Justice card to power thwart events leaving Quincarrier alone to power captive ally abilities or Wakanda Forever.  13 HP, Shang Chi, White Tiger, and Moon Knight rescued.

						<comments>Finally got the win with Aggression Black Panther.  I decided to go slow and thin my deck some more.  I focused more on establishing allies more than upgrades and used the upgrades as resources until I could feel like I could put down upgrades.  It took forever, so I will have to start last scenario at 2nd main scheme stage (11 counters?).  10 HP though.  It was tough with nemesis showing up and all the curveballs that threw me along with Absorbing Man&apos;s traits.  Expert Absorbing man is probably the swingest of all the villains I think.</comments>

						<comments>Hmm... another loss to expert Absorbing man with BP aggression.  I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;m doing wrong.  I was actually not too far off, but he won on threat.  I wonder if I should just ignore the delay counters and use allies to block until BP is setup....

						<comments>Finally, legit win against expert Red Skull this time with DS Justice.  I put the proper threat at the beginning.  Overall it went smoother this time, since I didn&apos;t get swamped by minions early on like last time.  However, I did come close to losing to threat twice and I was glad I had &apos;Under Surveillance&apos; down.

						<comments>Big loss to expert Crossbones with Leadership Black Panther.  I wanted to try something different and using the buff up big ally strategy again and it didn&apos;t work again.  It didn&apos;t help that Shadows of the Past showed up and Legions of Hydra.  I wonder if there is too much competition between the allies, the buffs, and BP&apos;s gear that I can&apos;t do much. I wonder if usig allies as a resource is a better plan.  Draw up the allies to get more cards.</comments>

						<comments>Finally, legit win against expert Red Skull this time with DS Justice.  I put the proper threat at the beginning.  Overall it went smoother this time, since I didn&apos;t get swamped by minions early on like last time.  However, I did come close to losing to threat twice and I was glad I had &apos;Under Surveillance&apos; down.

						<comments>Going to have to put an asterisk on this one. I forgot to add the threat based on number of delay counters at the start.  Tough game anyway and almost lost (down to 1HP), and I fought my way back.  Justice Doctor Strange vs. Expert Red Skull.  I got way behind the minions even with allies.  I had to scratch and claw my way back.  I had a bad villain round with some bad treachy cards.  A boost that caused a villain activation with no boost cards about killed me.

Multiple Man came out at the right time to get toughed up with the Seven Rings of Raggadorr to help the good doctor to get setup.  Along with the stunning of Iron Fist and Vapors to keep Multiple men in play longer, gave more time for board setup.  Crossbones was defeated.

						<comments>Finally, I got a victory with Aggression Quicksilver against expert Rhino! Tough fought battle.  I think I did a better job of utilizing my allies better as shields and helpers more this time instead of getting blinders on making QS do everything.  It allowed me to setup better and I did make good choices when going back to alter-ego when I had too.

						<comments>Aggression Quicksilver losing to expert Crossbones.  I didn&apos;t play a single red card and I think that is a problem.  I focus too much on QS&apos;s cards and want to do too much.

						<comments>Yet another loss to expert Crossbones.  I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing wrong. I added more first aids to stay in hero form... didn&apos;t hardly use them.  I tried to play more aggression, but still not using it much.  I either get behind in threat or behind in health. I almost feel like I don&apos;t know how to play after so many losses.

						<comments>Aggression Quicksilver losing to expert Crossbones.  I didn&apos;t play a single red card and I think that is a problem.  I focus too much on QS&apos;s cards and want to do too much.

						<comments>Yet another loss to expert Crossbones.  I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing wrong. I added more first aids to stay in hero form... didn&apos;t hardly use them.  I tried to play more aggression, but still not using it much.  I either get behind in threat or behind in health. I almost feel like I don&apos;t know how to play after so many losses.

						<comments>Tough loss with Protection Dr. Strange against expert Crossbones. I was so close to finally being setup, but he got me on threat.  My nemesis did come out on me and the villain board got kind of out of control for a while.

						<comments>Finished off Expert Zola with She-Hulk Leadership.  Giant Man was the MVP with his Reinforced Suit and Team Building Exercise to bump him up to 7HP for hitting longer at 4 ATK.  It was touch and go as She-Hulk got down to 2 HP, but a big finish with the arrival of White Tiger and Elektra to help free Hell Cat and get the big win.

12 HP, one minion leftover and Improved Attack Upgrade

						<comments>Torched expert Red Skull with She-Hulk Justice.  I can&apos;t believe I took him down so fast, but it helped getting two captive allies (Moon Knight &amp; Shang Chi) in my opening hand and able to use their abilities along with getting QuinCarrier down all in turn one.  No threat, side scheme removed and ready for 3 encounter cards.   Elektra was MVP getting 15 damage done by recurring her through prison camp.   I could have ended the game a turn earlier because I forgot to use the Laser Cannon.</comments>

						<comments>As usual I ruled Taskmaster completely with She-Hulk Justice.  Having three beat cops in play really helps out to keep the threat in check.  It took a second round of the encounter deck to free all the captives, but I got them!

16 HP!!!  Full health for nasty Zola.</comments>

						<comments>As usual I ruled Taskmaster completely with She-Hulk Justice.  Having three beat cops in play really helps out to keep the threat in check.  It took a second round of the encounter deck to free all the captives, but I got them!

16 HP!!!  Full health for nasty Zola.</comments>

						<comments>Absorbing man schemes out on She-Hulk/Aggression.  Kept getting stunned to where I couldn&apos;t do anything.  Starting with 8HP was tough as well. I skipped the first turn to heal up to 13.

						<comments>Played with solo variant based on the Fall of Rome/Official new solo variant. I really like the one handed play with 3 roles combo.   However, I can&apos;t imagine playing this without the politician&apos;s ability to stash cards in the library.  I would lose too many cards.

						<comments>Crushed the expert Red Skull in the final round with Captain America Leadership.  Red almost defeated Captain America knocking him down to 1HP, but he was able to rally for a glorious finish.  Tactical Scanner was the MVP card of the game.  It was the first card I played at the start to help set my board up with quite a few cards.  Then came back in the final round at the right time.  My deck was almost empty after I fought my way back out of my 1HP hole.  Red Skull was sitting at 16HP (second stage).  I play Tactical Scanner to start my turn and draw 5 (at 10) cards because of Assess the Situation previous round).  I defeat Censor the Past side scheme to shuffle Tactical Scanner back into the deck and then draw two cards from Skilled Investigator and Improved Thward Upgrade (12 cards).  I play Fearless Determination to then draw Tactical Scanner again!!  I draw 5 more cards and triggers a reshuffle (16 cards).  I play Moon Knight and use Quincarrier to draw two more cards (17 cards) and draw Tactical Scanner AGAIN!!!!!  I draw 5 more cards (21 cards!!).  Let&apos;s just say Red Skull didn&apos;t survive that round.</comments>

						<comments>Long game, but Expert Zola went down to the power of Captain America Leadership.  10 HP.  I did free Agent 13.  I had the big finish with &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; (2 assess situations previous round), Steve&apos;s Apartment to to draw up to 13 cards in the round then finish off with Avenger&apos;s Assemble and shield toss (eliminate a guard). 21 total damage.    Giant man with reinforced suit is wicked good because it keeps him punching at 4ATK.</comments>

						<comments>Captain America Justice takes down Taskmaster.  I only freed two captives though: Moon Knight and Shang Chi.  It will have to do. I didn&apos;t feel like playing another hour just to free the other two who came up during boost draws.

						<comments>Much better round against expert Absorbing Man.  I took him down in 5 rounds with 11 HP (full health).  I took the tactical scanner but didn&apos;t use it this round and may not ever use it.  I may take the basic thwart upgrade this time for fun.</comments>

						<comments>Much better round against expert Absorbing Man.  I took him down in 5 rounds with 11 HP (full health).  I took the tactical scanner but didn&apos;t use it this round and may not ever use it.  I may take the basic thwart upgrade this time for fun.</comments>

						<comments>Captain America/Aggression throttles expert Crossbones in no time.  I didn&apos;t even use Heroic Strike nor did I finish going through my deck once.  Took all the experimental weapons though.  I haven&apos;t decided item to select.  11 HP full health, so no obligation cards this round.</comments>

						<comments>Good game against Expert Zola and Black Widow Leadership deck.  Ant man cards are so nice with the new upgrades for Iron Man and Giant Man with his big punch of 4.  The game got a little dicey in the early rounds as Black Widow was down to 2 HP setting up her board, but I eventually got enough allies down and Triskelion to do some work.  Ended with full heath of 13HP.</comments>

						<comments>Expert Absorbing Man schemed out on me on the first try with Black Widow/Aggression.   It was a tad slow and he was at 8 delay counters already and I probably had two turns to go.  Taskmaster nemesis showed up as well to slow things down more.</comments>

						<comments>Took Expert Absorbing man down in 6 turns this time.  Things went a tad smoother, but still tough.  I was able to finish out with Valkyrie, Dance of Death, and Upper Cut.  Martial Prowess and QuinCarrier came in handing.  Ended with 6HP though, so I&apos;m taking the Basic Recovery Upgrade.</comments>

						<comments>Finally got the win against Expert Crossbones with my old try and true Black Widow Justice.  Finished with 12 health, so no need to take an obligation card next round.  It was game of epic turns where I was down to 1 HP and 2 HP at different times, and I wasn&apos;t sure how I would make my way back but I did.</comments>

						<comments>Thor Justice finally took down Expert Zola!  First turn felt like a skipped turn because I put down Quincarrier and God of Thunder, but may have been the best move all along.  Eventually was able to get the board built up and took control.</comments>

						<comments>Finally I beat expert Taskmaster and Thor Justice.  I did a better job of managing threat and keeping the attachments at a minimum.  It was a long game, but I shut it down after freeing two captives: Moon Knight and Shang Chi. I&apos;ll have to go with that.  17 HP which means I start next round with 15 HP so I don&apos;t need to take yet another obligation card this time.</comments>

						<comments>Got the win against Expert Absorbing Man, but I&apos;ll asterisk, because I actually probably lost in the last second but didn&apos;t realize it until putting stuff away. I&apos;m counting it because I was close.  I feel like I&apos;ve forgotten how to play Marvel Champions.</comments>

						<comments>My first loss to expert Taskmaster!! Always due to threat with a Justice Deck!! What????  Man, I&apos;m off my game.  I used to own Taskmaster completely every time. It wasn&apos;t horrible loss, but I&apos;m wondering if being sick is really affecting me.</comments>

						<comments>2nd try with Thor Protection against Expert Crossbones in RoRS.  I took him down, but it was a tough fight.  I did better with the scheme, no Loki, but the scheme did get to stage 3.   I came close to losing with the Full Auto showing up before final turn. Drew 6 cards on Full Auto an barely survived to be able to finish off Crossbones.  I was down to 1 HP, but I put the helmet down to &quot;heal&quot; me to six before finishing him off with a Hammer Throw (very fitting).  Iron Fist saved my butt the last two turns.</comments>

						<comments>Solo Champions League Season 2 Round 3 Match 3 - Standard Ultron/Legions of Hydra with Captain Marvel Leadership.  Tougher start without Hawkeye.  I shifted my plan to U.S. Agent to be a drone sponge to eliminate drones with his retaliate and buffed with Honorary Avenger.  That helped but meant captain Marvel took more damage.   Unfortunately, I almost went to stage 3 of the scheme when I went alter ego to heal up. Survived.  I was able to Make the Call to get Hawkeye finally into play.  The biggest play was to flip Ultron to Stage II ad double tap with Goliath to do 10 damage!  Finished Ultron in two more turns with a win in turn 7.  It got a little hair there.</comments>

						<comments>This second practice round went much smoother. Round 1 Avengers mansion and Nadia.  I basically &quot;skipped&quot; the turn in alter-ego and figured I could deal with the extra threat with Rhino scheming on turn 1.  It worked out okay.  I took him down in 6 turns. Much better.</comments>

						<comments>Beat expert Absorbing Man with a tweaked aggression deck.  Recurring Press the Advantage with biopolymer suit and villain stunned is very nice. I did 8 damage this way on first turn. Nick Fury the save again and threat on main scheme was at 11!!   8HP, Laser Cannon, Recovery Upgrade.</comments>

						<comments>Took down expert TaskMaster with Ms. Marvel Justice.  Mostly controlled him even though it got a little hairy when my nemesis came out.  Thankfully, I was in alter ego and had a big hand draw round with my support in place to work them back down.  Loving the new Justice cards from RoRS in this set (Clear the Area &amp; Skilled Investigator). Combine it with Concussive Blow to allow Ms. Marvel to go into alter-ego mode along with Beat Cop to absorb threat each round and Under Surveillance for cushion. It&apos;s sweet.   14 HP.  Rescued White Tiger, Elektra, and Shang Chi</comments>

						<comments>Taking down expert Taskmaster with Spiderwoman. Too easy. In complete control by the time I had two Finesses, Jessica&apos;s Apartment, Beat Cop, Martial Prowess, and Spycraft down.   I just milked it out until I got the last allied rescued (3 total). 12 HP!  It&apos;s so much easier I think to capture allies here in expert using stun and confuse a lot and Spiderwoman can do this with Pheromones.</comments>

						<comments>Solo Champions League Season 2 Round1 Match 3.  Rough loss to Standard Klaw Bomb scare.  Felt like everything went wrong. Most of armor at bottom of deck. Nemesis comes out and makes me lose upgrades.  I could never get all my armor out, so it made it tough going hero form.  Turn 12 scheme out.</comments>

						<comments>Expert Red Skull ... rough with Hulk even though Justice helps. I took the obligation this time that really hurt by give me -1 on attributes.  I might have pulled it off but it had RS not drawn a 8 thwart round to push it the end. I went back I could have beat him had I let him not scheme that round.</comments>

						<comments>First round against expert Zola... oof. That was rough.  Took way too many turns to get my quiver which was almost at the end of my deck:(  I think I spent too much time not flipping Zola because of the minion draw, when I probably should have flipped him a long time ago. Those minions are brutish! He can go through his deck fast with pseudo surges searching for minions and then tech for zola mutates.</comments>

Quiver came out sooner, but I couldn&apos;t turn the corner again.  He can scheme/confuse or attack/stun you so quick.

						<comments>Solo Champions League Round 4 match 2. Black Panther / Leadership against Ultron Bomb Scare Expert.  Turn 14 win.  Tough battle.  It took a while to get Black Panther&apos;s upgrade train going.  
I had reshuffled my deck to get 3 wakanda forevers in hand to get Ultron flipped and down to 17 even while clearing minions.  Next 3 turns was almost all allies with all the defending BP had to do against upgraded drones  (+3rd stage Ultron upgrade).  Took two Make the Calls to Nick Fury to get Ultron down to 3.  Last hand was to play Hawkeye to clear last drone than Make the Call to get Wonder Man to land the killing blow. BP was exhausted.  Allies for the win!
I was so hoping to draw one more Wakanda forever to finish up Ultron those last three turns, but couldn&apos;t do it.
I had to let the main scheme go to stage 3 at turn 14 too, figure it was better than clearing more minions to finish off Ultron.

						<comments>Solo Champions League Round 4 Match 1 - Black Panther Leadership against Ultron Expert with Bomb Scare. Turn 11.

Tough match, but I pulled it off. I think I like how my deck worked with the extra cards to mitigate the drone minion pull on my deck so I feel like I have options to replace cards that get converted.  My deck was 46 cards. The extra six cards seemed like a good number with how many drones happen between going through my whole deck . I went through it twice.  In stage two of villain, it is very easy to do two drones per villain phase without extra treachery cards.

Falcon came in handy getting the threat down.  I used almost every ally at least once... except mockingbird surprisingly.  I did consider using &quot;blockingbird&quot; though but went with something else at the time to get more thwart.  I think it was Iron man who got some work done.  It took forever to get Hawkeye out. I gave him up first hand to get and Avengers Mansion down and I&quot;m ot sure if that was a good tradeoff. However, it helped getting him again eventually.</comments>

						<comments>Another win with Black Panther Aggression on standard Klaw with MODOK.  Definitely need the allies to keep Black Panther in the game while laying out the board.  BP seems slower than I would expect.  Mean Swing is so nice since BP comes with two weapons that can be exhausted that don&apos;t stop their special ability.</comments>

						<comments>WOW.  Klaw + MODOK could have been more rough. MODOK came out in turn 4, I had to sit and think awhile.  I decided to ignore him and go for finishing off Klaw and hope a guard didn&apos;t come out.  I made it at turn 6.. phew. 3 Avengers Mansion probably helped.</comments>

						<comments>Long tough win against Standard Klaw Masters of Evil with Black Widow Leadership.  I&apos;ll have to asterisk this one because I didn&apos;t play Klaw&apos;s stun converter correctly, it should have been stunning my blockers (although he was killing them). I need to figure out the attacrobatics interaction with stun converter plus stun on me and widowmaker interaction. I&apos;m thinking attacrobatics does nothing and widowmaker doesn&apos;t fire</comments>

						<comments>First time playing Doctor Strange. Prebuilt deck. Ultron Standard with Under Attack.. Wow. Put the hurt on Ultron. First solid win with Protection. The cards are just too good. Unflappable... wow!  Desperate Defense is not too shabby in a pinch!  Iron fist is worth the 4 cost!

Then there is Doctor Strange&apos;s hero/invocation decks... wow.</comments>

						<comments>First time playing Doctor Strange. Prebuilt deck. Ultron Standard with Under Attack.. Wow. Put the hurt on Ultron. First solid win with Protection. The cards are just too good. Unflappable... wow!  Desperate Defense is not too shabby in a pinch!  Iron fist is worth the 4 cost!

Then there is Doctor Strange&apos;s hero/invocation decks... wow.</comments>

						<comments>Standard Rhino. Tried Thor taking Avengers Mansion and QuinCarrier out and putting two haymakers in for damage and energy.  Worked well. Slow game only because it took a while to get Asgard down... I think.    Of course, having Under Surveillance down makes me slow down I think.  I&apos;m more okay with going alter-ego to heal when I have threat down.   I did a turn with two hammer throws off and then a later turn with 8 damage lightning strike!</comments>

						<comments>I&apos;m liking Thor Justice now, but I&apos;m still a fan of Justice.

Second Match of Round 1 Solo Champions League.
Rhino Standard + Masters of Evil
7 Turns
5 health left
0 villain + minions
0 threat

Good win.  I would have had Rhino in 6 if it wasn&apos;t for the tough status showing up to extend it one more round.</comments>

						<comments>Got the win against standard Green Goblin Risky Business with Ms. Marvel.  Did quite well even though main scheme got to level two.  I probably only used only 3 protections cards the whole game: Tackle (for stun), Med Team for the heals, and two energy barriers to reflect damage.</comments>

						<comments>Amazing win with Black Widow aggression. Standard Wrecking Crew. I was inspired by Frankie (aka BrokenAxe) to try this after his SGOYT post about his experience.  She rocked the crew and kept them under control. She became a beast once she got Endurance and Down Time down.  Counterattack was critical many times and got me the final blow on Wrecker.</comments>

						<comments>Another interesting game with the bot. I forgot to test my rule about deploying troopers. I had an epic battle near the end of about four missions to slow down the empire&apos;s advance towards my rebel base.  I was able to stop his fleet, but he had a mission that revealed the base.  It was too late though, I completed my final objective to get the win during refresh phase.</comments>

						<comments>Rough and long game against Green Goblin Mutagen Formula.  Jachin nearly got knocked out and I got down to 4HP.  We were able to claw our way back to victory with a quite a walloping in the last round.  Jachin drew a ton of cards to really do some work taking out the Goblin Thralls and getting GG down to 3 hp.  Ms. Marvel tackled him for the finish.</comments>

						<comments>Interesting game. I heard all the hype about this, but it was quite good for an adventure game. Clay had a pieced together copy that he paid someone for. I think it was mostly the cards which is mostly the whole game anyway.  We made it farther than Clay has been.  We stopped when we headed to a third location. </comments>

						<comments>Close win that Jachin would have won next round.  I got him with the ground combat (Crippling Blow) to finish the win. I had to evacuate the base and relocated because his Death Star was too close.  Not as cinematic a finish as our first game, but still fun.</comments>

						<comments>Point Luna with Prelude.  A good win where I was able to cruise to the finish line with calculated ease.  Started with an ironworks strategy and got my energy up to 4 right off the bat.  I also primed the heat with 2 and was able to boost to up to 17 heat just past halfway through.  </comments>

						<comments>I tested out a play against Rhino Expert/Under Attack before playing the offiical solo league match with Black Widow. I&apos;ve never played Expert before, and I know BW is going to have trouble with her lower HP count.  I chose Captain America so I would feel cheating since the league game is a one-shot attempt.   Let&apos;s just say Cap&apos;n crushed it in 5 turns.  Rhino came at him with double charge, but shield block stopped the 10 HP attack.  BW would not have handled that well.   The match would have been 4 turns but the stupid Vibranium armor slowed things down.</comments>

						<comments>Season 0 of league play
Black widow with my first custom deck. I tweak a few cards.

Played Rhino Standard with Masters of Evil.  It got touchy around turn 3 &amp; 4 where health got down to 3, but I was able to storm bag with plenty of prep cards. Counter Surveillance came in handy giving me breathing room to heal up while the villain schemed.  After that, I was able to cruise and manage things until I put the final blow with a prep card combo for the hit.  I had both gauntlets down and plenty of prerparation cards in the tableau by turn 6.  Espionage didn&apos;t come into play, but it might prove more useful against Klaw&apos;s Weapons Runners</comments>

						<comments>Played against Rhino with Black Widow.  She&apos;s pretty cool. I kind of like her and is probably my favorite female superhero to play.  I like the way her &quot;Preparation&quot; card combs work.  She kind feels like Iron Man/BP, but her &quot;armor&quot; only sticks around until used.</comments>

						<comments>Tough loss.  I was playing Science and had a really hard time figuring out what to do.  Again, you have to go on the rampage to keep from losing.  However, my score was still &quot;Defeat&quot; :(  Not sure how to approach Science differently since you need Science icons.  Keep the Hull in good shape and nemo as well would help.</comments>

Captain America just shellacked them.  I took out PileDriver first round to avoid his Distracting Taunts.  Shield Tosses put a hurt on everyone and a couple of Heroic Strikes to stun the active villain.  Bulldozer was second to go, then Thunderball who got one stun in, then finally wrecker.</comments>

						<comments>Good to get my solo variant to the table.  First time I ended with a tie and realized that I need tie-breaker rules.

1st tie-breaker - generate the most points on last round.
2nd tie-breaker - generate the most income.
3rd tie-breaker - cards in hand greater than zero.
4th tie-breaker - highest development
5th tie-breaker - highest world

I generated the most points on last round 28 to 26, so I put it as a win.  Seems fair if your engine can generate more points at the end.</comments>

						<comments>Played the promo pack 1 for the first time. I played both spirits too! Heart of the Wildfire and Serpent that Slumbers under the island.  

Really good and long game.  No adversaries and one blight card. I kept the island healthy which was tricky with HofW putting down blight everywhere.  Of course he can remove it with enough elements. I got a win by clearing out the city at Terror Level III.  </comments>

						<comments>Interesting game.  I feel like it could be improved with more decisions and better luck mitigation options.

Capturing forts should be more rewarding, because thematically you&apos;re defenses have improved. </comments>

						<comments>A really good game. This was my first time playing with &quot;A Spread of Rampant Green&quot; and my first time playing against Kingdom of England Level 1.  I didn&apos;t think I had a chance, but I started to figure out Rampant&apos;s tricks.  You really have to focus on getting sacred sites down as much as possible so you can prevent build and ravage actions.  

A found out how immensely useful the &quot;Powerstorm&quot; major power card is to have when playing solo.  It basically replaces its cost by providing three energy (it&apos;s cost) and allows you to repeat the power of another card so long as you pay for the power&apos;s cost.  It came in very handy.

I came close to winning with terror level II win conditions, but I had to push for a fear victory to win it all before it could get real bad.  England was very tricking with it&apos;s special build actions. I can&apos;t imagine playing England at Level 3 or higher.</comments>

						<comments>Tried adapting the dice pool rules to the solo variant, and it worked well.  Setup dice pool as usual and get six dice per color for the dice bag and away you go with the private dice pool rules. At the end of the game leftover dice pool dice get added to the target score.</comments>

						<comments>Thor against Ultron.  Took him down but it was close.  Thor did better with more minions in play so he could draw 2 extra each phase he was in hero form.  It was a very satisfying end to the game where Ultron&apos;s countdown just started, Thor&apos;s obligation came out as Thor had 5 remaining hit points, Ultron was at 8 hit points... what do you do?  I chose to exhaust (already in Odinson) to remove card. Flip to Thor and use Hammer throw for the finish!</comments>

I found the interplay of delegates and dominant party with the events intriguing, but boy oh boy the game time stretches out and takes up more board space... and more fiddly to setup and teardown.

I have mixed feelings. I do like the player boards.</comments>

						<comments>First time playing Thor and second time with the Wrecking Crew.  It seemed fitting since the two go together based on the early comics.  Thor fared better than Iron Man/Justice, but I just couldn&apos;t finish them.  It dragged out a long time, but they schemed out. I was possibly too aggressive with the Defender of the Nine Realms card plays because it makes them cycle their deck faster which leads to acceleration tokens (more threat in the long run), but Thor doesn&apos;t have much besides that card to deal with threat.</comments>

						<comments>Played Chainbound event.  Lost my one play but I almost caught up to him.  He kept hitting me with key cost bumps just as I got my double S. Shrix and double G. Spirals going.  They were too long to setup and my hand even after mulligan was bad.

My opponent, Alex, is going to the World Vault Tour Championship this year (2020).  I&apos;m glad I almost beat him.</comments>

						<comments>New AoA deck lost. It&apos;s almost a racing deck, but not quite.  If it had 3 or 4 more amber pips, I think the distribution would be good for racing.  Right now, my shadows house is great for bursting.  Sanctum is possibly my main house with 6 creatures.  </comments>

						<comments>New AoA deck lost. It&apos;s almost a racing deck, but not quite.  If it had 3 or 4 more amber pips, I think the distribution would be good for racing.  Right now, my shadows house is great for bursting.  Sanctum is possibly my main house with 6 creatures.  </comments>

						<comments>Actually beat the tournament coordinator.  My double Golden Spiral and double Senator Shrix caught me up and got me the win cause he didn&apos;t have the cards to kill off the Shrixes. I probably generated close to 20 amber in 3 rounds without playing cards for the win.</comments>

						<comments>Really cool game. I really like how streamlined how the overseer is compared to the Imperial player in SW:IA.  The give and take of adrenaline is a very cool mechanic.  The tactics of the squad is pretty cool too.  Jachin said he likes SW:IA better, but this is still worth getting.</comments>

						<comments>EPIC GAME! Jachin pulled off the most movie-worthy climactic.  After I failed to get the Death Star in on the rebel base, my fleet had to withdraw from the base after bad second rolls and losing Star Destroyer.  He moves the base with only 3 planets left... I had only one fleet near one possible location, and his base happened to be there.  One Star Destroyer against two Y-wings and ... loses! Game over!</comments>

						<comments>This was a bear to setup and seemed overwhelming, but once you got into the game it got smoother.   It was a bear to teardown as well.  It helped getting the train to help me move anywhere I wanted to instead of constantly stringing my assistants together for movement. I could focus more on planning and hitting the spots I wanted with assistants when I needed them.</comments>

						<comments>Eve and I squeaked out a win by almost plaguing out. Farmer took a scar from San Francisco which eventually became Forsaken. That was our first forsaken city.  At least it is on the edge of the map.  We still need to the the last recon that we know of in Cairo, but at least we now have a permanent supply center there.  </comments>

						<comments>I scored &quot;Pretty Good&quot; for this solo variant.  It was decent for a beat your own score variant. You have to really enjoy the placement puzzle of Qwirkle which I do.  The discard is nice in how to plan ahead knowing what is out of the game and what you could possibly score.</comments>

						<comments>Zoe and I played her Christmas gift for the first time. It was good. It feels a little like Ticket to Ride. We played the regular game.  I like that it has more advanced rules that you can mix and match into the game. The Supernova rules sounds very thematic.  I won the game, but it was close.  I think Angel might like it.  It&apos;s not too brain burny, has the rummy/ticket to ride feel, and has options to play a shorter or longer game, two page of rules.</comments>

						<comments>Good game against Klaw 1/2 with Masters of Evil. I played She Hulk/Justice and Jachin was Iron Man/Aggression.  We handled the threat decently, and I finished him off. I thought She-Hulk was going to get knocked out and Jachin would have to take out the villain at 1HP.  However, I forgot that I could go alter-ego to avoid getting knocked out with 4HP.  That pushed his scheme to the next level, but Klaw was dealt with after that phase.</comments>

						<comments>Fought Klaw again and Masters of Evil. I was playing She-Hulk with Justice Aspect, and I almost beat Klaw. I learned the value of Avengers Mansion which really helps She-Hulk in Hero Form.  Focused Rage is useful too in combo with Avengers Mansion to get yet another extra card (for 2 more).  The damage from Focused Rage can help setup for Gamma Slam which turned out to be my undoing. Even though I nailed Klaw for 14 damage, I couldn&apos;t quite survive the villain round when he drew Sound Manipulation to kill me.  Good game!</comments>

						<comments>Jachin and I took on Klaw with BP/Leadership and She-Hulk/Protection.   Got beat, even though I felt like we were on the cusp. Jachin felt like he couldn&apos;t draw enough Wakanda Forevers to get going. I really struggled with She-Hulk&apos;s crummy hero hand size to be effective.</comments>

						<comments>Beat the Klaw with Panther Leadership.  However, I didn&apos;t really use Leadership hardly at all (maybe 2 cards, Maria Hill and the one phase buff).  I really cranked the Wakanda Forever engine particularly at the end with Ancestral Knowledge to prime a previous 3 WF move back into the deck,  then Golden City, then Golden City next turn, flip hero and WF three more times.</comments>

						<comments>Jachin and I played standard Rhino again. It was Jachin&apos;s 2nd game.  He played Captain Marvel aggression and I play Iron Man Justice.  We smacked Rhino down.  I eventually did 21 damage with 3 repulsor blasts, powered gauntlet, and two attacks, and Jachin finished him off with energy channel.</comments>

						<comments>We taught Eve. She played the cats, and she tried to go for dominance but failed.  It was a pretty good move given her position, but Jachin and I were able to work it.  I was able to pull out the win with the &quot;Royal Claim&quot; card before Jachin could win on his turn.  It was a very fitting end given that I was playing the birds.</comments>

						<comments>Jachin and I played the Co-op variant against the cat bot.  We won.. yeah! Woodland Alliance took forever to ramp up, but once they did... watch out.   Vagabond pairs nicely with the Alliance feeding them cards they need and getting items he needs.</comments>

						<comments>Got the win on my first try.  It was very brain burny compared to Brikks and Qwixx.  I&apos;m not sure how much Zoe will like it or Angel.   It takes things up quite a notch from Qwixx, but I like the &quot;chain&quot; bonus effects.</comments>

						<comments>Beat the Shadow Syndicate, but I realized about 2/3 of the way through I was playing it wrong... I can only use one location bonus once per turn, not use the location bonus once per turn per location.  Crushed the SS 77 to 34. </comments>

						<comments>Actually a close game. Will was going to win it unless I finished the game by using up all six tiles because he was 5 points ahead of me with qwirkles to be made.   I was able to end it in one fell swoop to keep him from the qwirkles.</comments>

						<comments>Played solo variant with personalized character AI decks. I was Han Solo against Jyn Erso.  It wasn&apos;t much of a challenge.  I beat it 10-6.  I&apos;m not sure the Jyn Erso is competitive and gets lost sometimes especially trying to get her personal goal accomplished.</comments>

						<comments>Played Vital Strength of the Earth with the blight card and no progression power card (normal).  Very good game.  Vital was very interesting to play.  You had to be even more strategic with the presence and focus more on getting sacred sites built for the extra 3 defend.  His energy ramps up faster than card play, so I went for more major powers more than minor powers. Tsunami came in very handy cleaning off a couple of areas on the coast.  I eventually won in Terror Level III with a fear card allowing me to do enough damage to the last city.  I wasn&apos;t far from a fear victory either.  Love how you really have to plan the many was to attack each round.</comments>

						<comments>Fun &quot;draw&quot; and write game.  I think the kids might like it.  I didn&apos;t fully understand the real estate multiplier so I missed out on that but did well in other areas.  We also got a rule incorrect about reshuffling the decks when someone completes a goal.</comments>

						<comments>I beat Han. It helped that he got some routes that were taking him back forth across the rim to slow him down.  I felt bad taking a bounty out on Chewy when I had him as a crew member. I didn&apos;t eliminate him though.  The story is we turned him in for the bounty then rescued him later;)

						<comments>Lost to Han in  a very close game 11-12.  I would have won had I won my battle against Saw Gerrara.  I had a cool encounter where I defeated Han to collect a bounty then turned around next turn to collect bounty on his crew member Greedo since he couldn&apos;t go anywhere.  Picked up the Chromium Hull to add +1 to fame each time fame increased.</comments>

I was able to line up a lot of cargo and jobs along the right path to get the fame cranking even though the bot took an early 3-0 lead.

Might even be more powerful than Boba Fett for bounty hunting although he didn&apos;t do much of that.  Also powerful for patrol hunting.</comments>

						<comments>I came so close to winning, but an Imperial Star Destroyer parked itself right on top of the Hutt patrol I was going to take out which slowed me down enough for Jachin to get the win.  I had gone into patrol hunting mode at the end because it was the fastest way to victory.  I had proton torpedoes that doubled my fame with patrols and an autolaser that combo&apos;ed well with Jyn&apos;s ability to convert eye rolls into two damage.  I really like Jyn&apos;s ability for combat and skill tests.  It almost makers her &quot;skilled&quot; with any skill she doesn&apos;t have and highly skilled with skills she does have.</comments>

						<comments>Played Solo with Solo.  I won, but it was slow going.  Good thing the bot got tied up a few times with patrol to help me get ahead.  I do like the bot spending money for fame to keep the pressure up.  The bot is easy to operate as well.</comments>

						<comments>Tough win against Logi, but I think I figured out how to deal with it on the fragmented server.  You have to keep moving to prevent flares from piling up on the same server.  I came close to running out of sparks and guardians.  It was tense.  I also almost got stuck on the other side of 3 firewalls blocking my path where I needed to go.</comments>

						<comments>Eve and I got the win! Whoop! We both played two roles in the second part of April.  We actually completed 4 objectives.  We found the lost haven in the pacific which gave us cool powers such as inoculate city with portable antiviral lab cards (extra 3 supply on make supply) and we reconned London to give us shuttle flight ability.  I&apos;m starting to feel better about this game even though adding cities is annoying by stretching supplies thin.  Inoculation will probably help with that as another way to combat the shrinking supplies.  At least we got a hidden supply cache with Pacific Haven (now called PHantasy).</comments>

						<comments>Close game, but the Archivist, Contingency Planner, and Field Operative came through.  I almost ran out of dice in the bag a few times.   I had a lot of cross dice for a while to pay for events. Part of that was thanks to Contingency Planner, but also rolled alot.   The Archivist was very nice.  However, it took me forever to find a cure with the blue dice even with five and six dice rolling at a time.</comments>

						<comments>Got the win in the 2nd half of March. We found the Lab Opal in Buenos Aires... very nice.  That gives us immunologist.  We were able to get the win right before Instabul broke out bad with plague.  My last move was to put the supply center in Istanbul to protect the population and kept me safe from its plague since game ended right away.   We put a permant supply center in Londo so we can recon the area.  </comments>

						<comments>Eve wanted to play again right away, so that&apos;s a good sign.  She got the win too, but I was surprised how close it was.  She crushed it in bird points with 41 and with bonus cards, but was weak every where else.  I stunk at bird points with 22, but came in strong at the end with 23 egg points, 15 end of round points, and 12 tucked cards.</comments>

						<comments>Jachin squeaked out a win in the &quot;Captured&quot; mission.  It was a very close win and I almost got enough to wound his last character but couldn&apos;t roll enough.  I tried to surround the escape exit, but couldn&apos;t get enough figures there either.</comments>

						<comments>Got the win with the sailor and the scientist.  Played with 5 epidemics.  Things went smoothly for most of the game.  However it took me a while to get a yellow hospital built and black cure. Blue wasn&apos;t a problem until end game when epidemics really hurt and might have run out of cubes had I not gotten some timely events to get the final research done on black. 4 epidemics drawn and 3 outbreaks.</comments>

						<comments>Played Spider SMC. I realized I was playing it harder than I should be.  It&apos;s when the contaminants are surrounded on every side by sparks/guardians that they are deleted!! I was doing any adjacent partition with sparks/guardians... duh. No wonder I thought it was harder than Viking.


I&apos;m trying to construct a challenge with this.  I couldn&apos;t get the last countermeasure done, but I might have been able to had I played Spider correctly early rounds.  I would have had more blue available for finishing the last goal. I came up way too short even after moving the blue server.</comments>

						<comments>First time with Rupert... very nice.  Played against Viking, but I&apos;m still not sure I&apos;m playing it correctly.

Countermeasures: Double Switch, Swarm, and Trojan Horse.

Swarm is nasty, but the perfect counter is to get a Neural Hub down in the swarm server.  From there I could shift things around and attack as needed. Rupert&apos;s purple token came in very handy.

						<comments>An abysmal win against the Viking SMC.  First, I totally blew the copper countermeasure of getting an neural hub down.  I didn&apos;t plan it at all. I think my brain was thinking uplink or I had enough time just to realize on last round I didn&apos;t have enough time.  I misplayed the Gold and tried to make up for it, but I barely made it out.</comments>

						<comments>Played the extra card keeping Green guy Rex? 

SMC: Viking, Full intel variant.   

Copper - get a virus on two partitions
Silver - get uplink or hub on 2 servers closed partitions (easy given setup)
Gold - connect 3 access points with nodes and ports including Faith  access point.

This turned out to be easy although I screwed up the spark steps again.  I would have had 6 extra sparks to deal with had I done it correctly so that is another reason it was easy.</comments>

						<comments>Played Spider with Countermeasures: Clockwork Plague, Viral Overload, and Flash Flood.

First time playing spider and it was brutal with its spark adjacent abilities.

I used Oshin Noro and Hettie Magnetic, so first time playing two renegades and it worked out well. Powerful combo.

I almost beat Flash Flood but it was so hard to complete.  I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out to win it on the last turn.  I thought figured it out only to realize after it was all done I needed a data port fro the network which I didn&apos;t have enough to put on Flash Flood. Good game. I was quite proud of myself pulling that maneuver at the end.</comments>

						<comments>Ethan taught me his prototype abstract game that was quite good.  It&apos;s hard to explain, but it uses mass and gravity to manipulate cubes on a board by making connections between them.</comments>

						<comments>Wow.  This really is good.  The jargon isn&apos;t that bad, but I&apos;m fairly techno savvy with computers and networking.  I probably spent more time going over the steps over and over again.  

The decision space is amazing in this game!  I love the fact that you&apos;re on limited by your resources (command points in your hand) and not a fixed number of actions.  Kind of what I like about Terraforming Mars.  You can take as many actions as you possibly can based on your tableau and resources.

This has potential to become a favorite in my collection.  Very rich game.</comments>

						<comments>Solo Trendy bot, this time no development and no starting Galactic Trendsetters, just starting Galactic Advertisers.

Barely won, but it took Galactic Federation to get over the hump.  50-37.  It would have one with a starting Galactic Trendsetters, but would not have won with the development in round 6.</comments>

						<comments>Solo Alien Bot.  Barely got the win in 6 rounds. It would have crushed me at the Alien Tech Institute came out in 7 rounds, however, I would have squeaked a win if it came out in 6 rounds by 2 points.   52-45, 6 rounds.</comments>

						<comments>Solo Bot, +1 and TP.

Beat the bot fairly well in 7 rounds.  51 to 43.   I&apos;m wondering if I&quot;m better now so the &quot;hard&quot; bot isn&apos;t as hard. It helped that I got TP down on first that negates its advantage.  It was still hard working the deck to keep the bot from getting ahead.  Trying a more difficult bot next round.</comments>

						<comments>Played the &quot;Alien&quot; Solo bot first time. Destroyed me. I think it may be too strong.  7 rounds 61-43.  I may dial it back by giving it only one yellow world to start that way when Alien Tech Institute comes in it&apos;s not quite as crushing. I still need to play a couple more times this way before trying to dial back so I can confirm if it&apos;s too harsh.</comments>

						<comments>Crushed the bot this time, 80 to 51.  I may have to rethink the dual card play to have it look for a combined cost for a 7,8,9 cost world./development card when it&apos;s in that cost range.  I think it will help the bot plunk down a high value card when it needs to because those tend to synergize with other cards.</comments>

						<comments>Solo bot design test. I figured out what to do with Contact Specialist.  Bot always get to play CS at zero cost along with any other cards it can play within the &quot;cost&quot; constraint.  Playing CS can also help the bot land a non-alien military world on the same turn CS is played if possible.</comments>

						<comments>Solo bot design.  the bot won this time at the end, but I think I&apos;ve come up with a better way to optimize the bots strategy on its turn.

Instead of the bot matching with a world for a world or a development for a development,  look at all matching cost worlds and developments in the deck and pick the one the scores it the most points.

						<comments>Another bot win in the very end.  67-65.   I may have something worth sharing for others to test.

What I changed for the world or development, I think I will do the same when doing both world and development.  Find the cost combo that maximizes points.</comments>

						<comments>Solo bot design play.  DIdn&apos;t have the same issue crop up again, but I still crushed it.  I think I need to redo the rules when you play both dev and world for the bot.  I think it&apos;s getting lost with my current rules and the play turns out suboptimal.   I&apos;m also thinking about doing away with the contact specialist rule and have the bot always able to play military rules.  I think this will stream line the bot and make it more challenging.</comments>

All their abilities were sweet, and I used them a lot.  This was a solo challenge on the 1PG guild.  I used the hot zone effects a couple of times.  I had two outbreaks and four leftover CDC dice.  First three cures were easy, but getting the last one started to go downhill fast.  QS saved my butt a lot of times.</comments>

Efficient Victory - my best yet.  I crushed it with four Galactic Trendsetters on my last four turns.  A whopping 32 points on the last turn  + 1 for Contact Specialist.</comments>

Excellent Victory -  Nailed on the last turn by laying down a New Galactic Order and Rebel Stronghold to get me past 70.  I wasn&apos;t sure if I would make it or not, because it took me a while to start getting points laid down.</comments>

Science Victory.  I wasn&apos;t sure if I could pull this off, but I did after taking my first 3 turns by placing only one card.  It ramped up fast after I got two uplift researchers than finally uplift code.  I got 10 chromosomes at the end, and I pulled a whopping 32 cards on the last income round.</comments>

						<comments>Barely got the win on the skirmish against Jachin.  We played the R2-D2/C3PO skirmish map (Weyland Outpost?).  Cool capture the flag with the holochron which I got with the Royal Guards to bring back (they were my fastest).  I got the 15VP which means I didn&apos;t need to kill Jachin&apos;s Chewbacca.  His Luke Skywalker was so tough with Chewie standing next to him.  I was able to pull the win with Kayn Samos using the Firing Squad a lot and taking out his Rebel Troopers in the end.</comments>

						<comments>Abysmal.  This game felt broken with the way it revealed riddle clues that didn&apos;t lead to opening other locks because the rest of the riddles were inaccessible.  Supposed to be easier than Pharah&apos;s Tomb, but it was harder.  Didn&apos;t like.</comments>

He had two really bad rolls that could have won him the game had it gone the other way.  That allowed me to finished wounding his last hero way far away from the ship (Ferris). </comments>

						<comments>Played Imperial Hospitality. I had to fudge things as Imperial to make things more interesting.  The Rebs have grown so powerful, this one would have been a cakewalk for Jachin.  He practically had all my units almost eliminated by round.  I started putting extra units in to give him a challenge or would have been a very boring mission.</comments>

						<comments>Played Temptation, and Jachin rocked it with Diala on her lightsaber quest.  She had the Art of Movement let her get to the holocron chamber on first round.  I should have deployed heavy troopers inside the chamber.  Jachin could have lost, but he went for the attack at risk of losing at the end of the round to take out Vader.</comments>

						<comments>I won skirmish with Boba Fett. He rocks on the moisture farm mission where you capture areas.  He could move through the impassable/blocked terrain easily. I also brought a Nexu for mobility.  I used Temporary Alliance to get Diala and elite Rebel Saboteurs, since the Scum/Villainy deployment deck is thin and Jachin took the Hired Guns.  It worked out well, because we rocked.  Even though Jachin&apos;s Finn took down my Diala, she did some damage and got a figure in the process.  I loved Boba Fett&apos;s armor.  The built-in block and evade made Jachin miss a lot!</comments>

						<comments>Played Temptation, and Jachin rocked it with Diala on her lightsaber quest.  She had the Art of Movement let her get to the holocron chamber on first round.  I should have deployed heavy troopers inside the chamber.  Jachin could have lost, but he went for the attack at risk of losing at the end of the round to take out Vader.</comments>

						<comments>I won skirmish with Boba Fett. He rocks on the moisture farm mission where you capture areas.  He could move through the impassable/blocked terrain easily. I also brought a Nexu for mobility.  I used Temporary Alliance to get Diala and elite Rebel Saboteurs, since the Scum/Villainy deployment deck is thin and Jachin took the Hired Guns.  It worked out well, because we rocked.  Even though Jachin&apos;s Finn took down my Diala, she did some damage and got a figure in the process.  I loved Boba Fett&apos;s armor.  The built-in block and evade made Jachin miss a lot!</comments>

						<comments>We played &quot;Under Siege&quot; of core set.  Wow! Awesome mission.  I was able to capture 3 tokens and I made a valiant surge for the last one.  Jachin had Diala camp out on last token, and I couldn&apos;t bring her down to capture the last.  I even somehow got Darth Vader there to wail on her once by using the Imperial Officer to keep ordering Vader to move during the Officer&apos;s turn.</comments>

						<comments>Close win on normal level.   Black got out of hand real fast towards the end.   I played the Agronomist and Sailor.  An unsual combination.  My sailor was mostly landlocked for the game with so many landlocked cards, so I only had a couple of handoffs. I was at 7 outbreaks on the last turn for the final research.</comments>

						<comments>Lost to Pericles: 70-66.  I did a good job of denying resources. The bot only got one wonder built, and I built all of mine.  However, it was for naught.  It was able to push through to get the victory. I think if I could have kept it from getting the last couple of shields it would have kept it out of the 10 point zone for the final 5 points.</comments>

						<comments>Played the stockholder and it was fun.  Still lost.  I  had at least 3 slaves caught that might have made the difference in the loss, because I was super close.  I had to push through on the next to the last turn, because Nat Turner&apos;s Rebellion was coming that would eliminate a support token.  I just couldn&apos;t make enough room for4 slaves.  Domestic slave trade hurt too by adding two more slaves to the market.</comments>

						<comments>Finally won with Station Master!!!! Woot!

I&apos;ll put an asterisk, because I thought I made a mistake and reset the game.  Then did my best to put it back the way it was when I realized I still had a chance to win after my mistake.  I had one slave market card left in the &quot;queue&quot;.</comments>

						<comments>Brutal loss.  Played Nurse and Politician.  I didn&apos;t not really get to utilize the Politician as well and didn&apos;t get cards handed out. I feel like I needed a third character in play to help manage the diseases.  I was close to having 3 diseases researched.  I also didn&apos;t see much yellow player cards during the game.  Eventually red disease overran us.</comments>

						<comments>Played Virulent Strain again with Dispatcher and Contaiment Specialist.  They worked well together much like the Medic except probably better since the CS can remove a cube automagically before a cure.

The virulent strain wasn&apos;t so virulent this time around.  Most of  the effects didn&apos;t pop or when popped weren&apos;t very damaging.  Got all the cures before the last epidemic occurred (4 epis and blue was virulent)</comments>

						<comments>First time trying the virulent strain... wow! that was amazing even with the loss.  I tried to put 4 epidemics in, but I think a card got stuck to another one, so I wound up with 5 cards in the deck... ouch.  It was fun though.

Epidemilogist - strange role
QS - saved our butts
Operations Expert - some what helpful

We died by too many outbreaks and would probably would have run out of cubes soon as well along with player cards.</comments>

						<comments>First time trying the virulent strain... wow! that was amazing even with the loss.  I tried to put 4 epidemics in, but I think a card got stuck to another one, so I wound up with 5 cards in the deck... ouch.  It was fun though.

Epidemilogist - strange role
QS - saved our butts
Operations Expert - some what helpful

We died by too many outbreaks and would probably would have run out of cubes soon as well along with player cards.</comments>

						<comments>Barely won the first of February.  Eve noticed how we could win before things got really bad.  Instead of reconning South America, we decided to take the connect two cities to the grid to complete the objectives.  We also got a permanent supply center set up in Sao Paolo, so we can recon it it next game.</comments>

						<comments>Woot! We got a win in January!  After the prologue and first game, I thought we would never be able to win, since it&apos;s so much harder than regular pandemic.  We got Chicago revealed.  We had to spend a point to get Sao Paolo back up to 2, because it&apos;s a major recon area.</comments>

Thankfully, I got Underground Detonation at the right time to start bumping up the heat production because I needed it bad.  Lava Flows, Import of Advanced GHG, and a nuke in the right spot helped get my heat going some more.</comments>

						<comments>DId well with ore processor early and a phobos space station.  I wasn&apos;t worried about oxygen too much, so I focused on energy to get heat.  I have the titanium to ocean converter card to help me out with water, but it took a while to get it down.  Heat was the biggest problem that I was able to catch up in the end.</comments>

						<comments>Day 2 - again, made it through destroying both battalions and almost running out of SO points.   Thankfully, the 4th battalion triggered 3 SO point gain

Day 3 is going to be hairy with two assault battalions breathing down my neck and 2 support battalion on the verge of entering the Front Rear.  I may not have enough SO points to make it to day 4.</comments>

						<comments>Mission #2 Tank Hunt - gah.. tough tough mission.  I got really lucky at times.  Those T-34a&apos;s were so hard to take down. I had to sacrifice units to go in close combat and lay a few mines down.  I still don&apos;t think I got all the rules right even with the mines.</comments>

						<comments>Played Combined campaign.

Adequate score.

Iraq 1991, short campaign. Jachin played the situation that required you to eliminate two battalions a day for the first two days.  Worked pretty well sharing targets, but really only two campaigns share a decent amount of targets between the two.  The combined campaign rules still have some issues like what if Jachin draws a shared target after selected shared targets with my map? Do I add those targets to my deck and my 2 closest bands?   Seems like the combined rules need more work.  Also, Jachin gets to pick targets, but I have to draw. can he designated a shared target to me without me having to draw? that&apos;s how we played it.</comments>

						<comments>Actually a really close game.  Pretty much came down to the last round of actions to determine the winner.   Anyone of us could have won, but I was able to squeak out a victory.  I was machines, Eve was pilgrims, and Jachin was Terrans. I had an epic snip move where I eliminated nine of Jachin&apos;s soldiers in one go on one round to slow him down and allow me to take over some of his regions.   The power of the machines is the ability to go last and use shredder drones.</comments>

						<comments>Got the win with Phobolog and pulled it out on the last turn.  Very satisfying win, because I struggle with them.  I definitely didn&apos;t waste my time jacking up the titanium mining too high like last game.  I was more moderate in both mining, and I think that helped although I still didn&apos;t see a lot to use the mining on as much as last time.</comments>

						<comments>Had an awesome heat, energy, titanium, steel engine going, just got it going about a turn too late.  Came up short, but I was paying for a lot of cards with steel and titanium.  I had advanced alloys as well, so my titanium was worth 5 MC.</comments>

						<comments>Got the win with Tharsis Republic... barely.  Had way too many turns where I couldn&apos;t utilize cards.  Very few space events. Huge energy engine that kept heat going, but nothing useful to utilize energy engine until very late in game - Power Infrastructure and Water Splitting Beam.  </comments>

						<comments>Took a big risk waiting to get a Jovian tag to play Beam from a Thorium Asteroid (32MC) as my starting hand.  It took me 4 turn to get it played I think, because it took me two turns to get IO Mining 41 !!!!  Pulled out the win in the last round.  Steel works helped me get the oxygen up.  I had to get creative to get caught up in time, because I had so many rounds of not doing much to save up money.</comments>

						<comments>Played the &quot;Raid&quot; mission with &quot;Supply Dump&quot; as the objective.   Really tough mission, but somehow I came out on top with no wounds.  I did forget to draw an event card in the elite hostile deck, but it wouldn&apos;t have matter.  It was aid station and we didn&apos;t have any wounds.

This tells a cool story where we hit heavy opposition near the supply dump.  A bunch of &quot;Houses&quot; had a half track and a machine gun nest defending it right before the supply dump.  When we got to the supply dump, there was a tank and a flamethrower with two sets of stragglers coming up from behind.  They must have got wind of us moving in on the supply dump.</comments>

						<comments>Saturn Systems on Hellas.  Really tough decisions this game.  I took 6 cards to start with, because it looked like it would make a good engine. I probably could have done without the wind power card that required 3 oceans.  I got it done in the nick of time although it started so slow.  I started with Ironworks and got my energy up enough to start using it. Around turn 10 I put Ore processor down, so that I was bumping the oxygen up twice a round with my 13 energy production.  Methane from titan came in handy as well to help push my heat up some more and plant production.</comments>

						<comments>Played &quot;Probe on the Loose&quot; scenario on Easy level.  It was pretty good and fun.  Easier than I thought it would be, but I think the malfunction card draw was nice to me.  Some of the &quot;events&quot; seem targeted to make life difficult based on the scenario.  One event damaged the explore capability, but I was done exploring before then.</comments>

						<comments>Finished the campaign with a score of 22 (good).  I had to leave the mission on day 6 because I couldn&apos;t see anyway of getting through the mission with &quot;Political Limitations&quot; in play.  My pilots would take too much fire trying to get to the target.  So, I jettison all air to ground munitions and bailed on turn one dodging the shots at us.  We took a little stress doing evasive maneuvers, but no got hurt.</comments>

						<comments>Played day 4 and 5 of Taiwan Defense campaign.  I&apos;m really starting to love the AIM-120 (AMRAAMS).  They make for a nice intro volley of missile on bandits on turn 1 with their range of 4 and can be fired independently.  It definitely cuts down on the opposition.  I use my first free 6 SO points to purchase them.  </comments>

						<comments>Played Local Materials scenario on easy. We squeaked out a win. I think we spent too many pawns to guarantee results and maybe should have risked more.  We had a lot of stupid events early on that required two tokens to resolve as well.  I&apos;m not sure if the last round went correctly. We staged the research actions assume we got the gravel before doing the duricrete action.</comments>

						<comments>Two more missions, and two more destroyed targets.  I took out a figther sweep and learned the power of AMRAAMS! Those were worth the free daily 6 SO points to carry on that mission to take out the fighters.  I was able to lay into them on the first turn and clean house, because I could fire them all on independent targets!

Second mission was a new minor airfield that was a little closer.   I took Eyes on this one with Merlin and Raider to share SA points amongst the pilots and that worked well.  I was thankful only a few bandits were there, and Eyes negated an event that would have had a bandit show up every turn.   I dropped the payload on the target without too much trouble.  Only one site gave me trouble where I had to evade and take on stress for Bacon who carried the payload.    Took more stress on the way home from AAA, because Eyes couldn&apos;t negate it.

Learned an important rule.  I DONT HAVE TO DRAW UP ALL THE RECON TARGET CARDS.  I CAN DRAW ONE AT A TIME IF I WANT TOO AND MAKE DECISIONS THEN.

Day 3 complete</comments>

						<comments>Tough loss in January for our first official campaign game.  We came so close, but almost all the blue cards we needed were at the bottom of the player deck. So the important people left to play drew blue at the end of their turn as we ran out.  We did complete one objective which is the supply centers.  It could have been worse, and only taking 4 plague cubes in 3 cities and no outbreaks and no exposure was not a terrible loss.  So 3 cities went down in population and 3 cities went up in population.    The &quot;Data Transfer&quot; rationed event card would have won us the game had it been available at the beginning of the game, but it wasn&apos;t revealed until the game ended by the legacy deck :(</comments>

						<comments>Got the win in the prologue with everyone.  Barely got it before taking our first plague cube.  Administrator came in handy to deliver final card.   The laborer used his ability twice to get supply centers.  It helped drawing the last two black cards for laborer.</comments>

						<comments>Day 1, Taiwan Defense 2008.  Attacked Power Station.  Trying to learn rules and got two rules wrong.  The station was fixed, and I was supposed to take JDAM weapons! So I shouldn&apos;t have been able to destroy it.  Also, took too many planes (8), and it should have been 6.</comments>

						<comments>Played 3 roles during prologue to learn the rules.  Wow! Very tough game. I barely lost, because I could have won it the next turn if I survived the infection round.  I took too many plague markers.  Man...

I had the Farmer, Radio Operator, Laborer.  Radio Operator is nice once some supply cubes are available.  Farmer is not bad either, but didn&apos;t use his ability much.  Laborer was the first guy I used to build a supply center.</comments>

						<comments>Ugh.. We played Guessing Game scenario.  It was tough going without food.  Just as we found the food Jachin&apos;s character died. I was close to death too.  He had the condition &quot;Anxiety Attack&quot; that killed him in the morale phase, because he didn&apos;t have morale tokens to spend.  None of us did have morale tokens the whole game.  It was tense and Jachin said he was stressed.</comments>

						<comments>Wow.  I tried &quot;Guessing Game&quot; again by myself given how Jachin and I failed.  I made it by the skin of my teeth on easy again.  Sheesh!  I would have lost the next round (day 5) had I not squeaked in a win. My engineer was done for when the morale phase hit, because he was almost dead.   Thankfully, the smart move was to double data mining action to on first round to help find the food container.  Even though the two data mined objectives weren&apos;t the food, the remaining one had to be the food objective.  So it took two more rounds to get to the food, since we had to explore one round and then the next to do a explore and gather.  It was tough too, because Garage hall had a broken CPU from the get go.  I had to shut down crew quarters and control center to keep going.  I need to read the rules about getting energy production back up again.  The events were brutal and different from the last game.   I did not complete the secondary objectives either.</comments>

						<comments>Played the tutorial with Jachin.  He was a big help since he paid attention to the Watch It Played video and I didn&apos;t.  I also didn&apos;t finish reading all the rules.  We barely lost by one broken part.  Tough game even on easy level. 

It was very overwhelming to setup.  Worse than Caverna and the game screams out for some serious organization to streamline setup and teardown.  The copy I got came with a DVG counter tray (Math trade) which helped, but it still needs more helps.  There are piles and piles of tokens, cards, and cubes of various categories.   I&apos;m still reserving judgment on this game, but I&apos;m not super stoked.  I have feeling this will go the way of Galaxy Defenders where I&apos;m constantly getting rules wrong every time I play. </comments>

						<comments>Crushed Eve on her second game, but she did better.  I was fortunate enough to get Physics Complex to churn out an extra 18 points!! Wow! I had no idea how potent that card was.  Of  course having Thorgate helped get the energy engine up enough to turn the crank for 2pts every round for 9 rounds.  I also scored &quot;Extreme Cold Fungus&quot; and &quot;Decomposers&quot; to combo that up for a total of 8 pts by end of the game with the help of a couple of nice space events that add animals (Fish &amp; Small animals) and microbes to cards.  I got the &quot;Builder&quot; and  &quot;Terrfomer&quot; milestones, and Eve got the &quot;Gardener&quot;.  She claimed the &quot;Scientist&quot; and &quot;LandLord&quot; awards while I got &quot;Thermalist&quot;.  I played Solenta on the first round to get all that heat (7 heat per round).

						<comments>Solo.  Lost to military victory, forgot Scott had shields on his wonders. Even though I tried to deny him resources and science, he snuck up on me that he had the discounts to pay for what he needed.  Soon as he got some coins in age 3, he did me in.</comments>

						<comments>Jachin and I tied, but I had the money to push it over the edge. I didn&apos;t have very many tiles on the board, but I got &quot;builder&quot; and &quot;terraformer&quot; milestones and Jachin got &quot;Mayor&quot;.  Jachin also got the &quot;Scientist&quot; and &quot;Landlord&quot; awards, and I got the &quot;Banker&quot;.  I had second place in &quot;Scientist&quot; and &quot;landlord&quot;. Eve tied for second place in &quot;Lanlord&quot; with me.</comments>

						<comments>Maggie and I went to a double tie-breaker.  We tied in money, and number of cards in warehouse.  I made a new tie-breaker rule of who had less good types wins, because of being more efficient with your goods.</comments>

						<comments>Did surprisingly well with IC.  It started out excruciatingly slow, but I was able to use the steel effectively. I eventually got the heat and energy up and titanium.  I never got plant production going, but I got regolith eaters early enough to work on oxygen.  It combo&apos;ed great with Imported Nitrogen and Imported Hydrogen to give me 3 oxygen boosts on top of the expected 3 I would get.  I had good discounts on space and events and optimal aerobraking to make playing space events more cost effective.  Space Catapult and energy catapult? came in handy near the end game allowing me to convert two steel into 12 megacredits, and I got power infrastructure down to use my 9 energy for money.</comments>

						<comments>Got ore processor early and cranked on it regularly. I did spend the first turn helping get the energy up enough to utilize it.   So very few greenery tiles put down.  I soon got heat up to take care of it.</comments>

						<comments>First time playing the new Hellas map from the first expansion.  Excellent map with wonderful choices.

Got the win although things slogged for awhile.  Got Martian Rails on first round which was vital.  By end of the game I was pumping out 27 MC by the end of the game with the help of the corp&apos;s power.  Heat didn&apos;t get really going until the last 4 rounds.</comments>

						<comments>Finally got a win with Phoblog.  I started out with three space events and decided to keep them.  I could pay for two of them on the first round, since one gave me four titanium.  The second one bump up my heat and plant production which was a good move. I was able to build a solid plant (4 per round) and heat (11 per round) engine within the first half the game that set me for the win.  Media group also came in handy by giving me the 3 MC bonus for events.   Midway through the game, I was able to get my energy up to 6 per round. Then a little steel and titanium production to rounds things out.  I was sitting on round 10 confident I would finish this.  By the later turns came around, I got Ecological Zone and Pets down (Birds on last round) to capitalize on some extra points.  I also got Noctis City, Capital, and Open Cities down.  I had to sacrifice my energy to get these cities down.</comments>

						<comments>My first win with Credicor...yeah!

Late comets really helped me out.  The takeaway... greenery tiles really cost 19 and cities cost 21. That is more powerful than I realized which means you can possibly put greenery down earlier.</comments>

						<comments>Military victory for me in 3rd age.  Zoe had a strong science strategy going, but she stalled out in money.  I kept flush, because I had the discounts on clay, wood, and stone but only one wood.  I had to burn a lot of cards to make sure I could pay for the discounts. I completed all my wonders, but I also had 3 go-again wonders.  I was surprised Zoe let me have the last go-again wonder on the second draft.</comments>

						<comments>Asterisk this one, I might have gotten an extra turn.

Tough tough start with Interplanetary Cinematics.  Practically nothing in the starting hand to start an engine. I just had late game cards mostly.

 Interplanetary Cinematics, * tough game. Starting hand was atrocious and didn&apos;t really get anything started until about turn 6.  No building tags were coming up the first few rounds.  Mole hole came in handy along with the robotic workforce to copy it so I could really get the heat going.  That was after getting the energy going mid game.</comments>

						<comments>Played Credicor, but came up 3 oxygen short.  I had a good energy engine by late game with Power Infrastructure.  I just couldn&apos;t get the heat going.  I had Acquifer Pumping to help me lay down the water cheaply and I did get Standard Projects in by mid game.  Just a hair two slow. I saw no good Space Event cards, so all the titanium I collected went to waste :(  Also, starting neutral tiles affected my gameplay by blocking half the good plant bonuses, so it was hard to get greenery in there to combo well which probably cost me at least one oxygen out of the 3 I lacked.</comments>

						<comments>United Nations Mars Initiative - Got the win.  Martian Rails came out first round, so I was able to pump the money up a lot. 24 by the end of the game with a few other cards.  I also had Regolith Eaters first round, so I was able to bump oxygen four times, and then got Steelworks mid game to continue to push oxygen.</comments>

						<comments>Tough game. Came up way short in oxygen for Phobolog.  Didn&apos;t have enough space events to really utilize Phobolog&apos;s starting titanium and more valuable titanium effect.  Makes for a very luck dependent game. Of course, it&apos;s hard to win the game without some space events that are efficient at terraforming anyway.</comments>

						<comments>Playing Tharsis Republic on VASSAL.  Good win. Utilized nitrite reducing bacteria right away to boost 3 TR throughout game. Got an extra TR from one of the comets that let me put 3 microbes on Nitrite Reducing Bacteria. Used predators to get the two animal cubes off of another card for 2 more points.    Utilized Steel works really well with my energy/heat energy that ramped up mid game.  I think I hit steel works 4 or 5 times to take the pressure off of getting greenery tiles down.. very cost effective for 15 + 3 MC (4 * 23 or 5 * 23.. huge).  Also did strip mine, got steel production up late game with plants two. When I saw I had plenty of heat to get to the end, I used insulation to boost my MC production up to 15 MC after placing capital city.</comments>

						<comments>Did much better against Zoe with Helion.  Nice being able to use heat as cash.  Started really slow and I didn&apos;t have very good cards to start with.  I worked with what I could and held onto two cards that require 4 water from the start (capital city and dam).  I did my best to boost heat as much as I could and got steel down quick.  She played a ton of cards and had another nice microbe animal VP engine going.  I scored all 3 milestones before she could which gave me a 15 pt edge. However, She got thermalist and miner awards by a country mile, and I got Landlord by the end of the game.  I had 4 cities and lots of interlocking greenery tiles to double and triple the points between cities.</comments>

						<comments>Legit win with Thorgate.

Used Martian Rails to keep bumping my money production up nearly every round. 

I was able to get heat and energy production way up.  Near the end of the game, I used insulation to shift my 14 heat production over to money production.  That was very nice.  I was producing 52 money at the last turn for a full 113.  I was flowing in the money.

Caretaker Contract score me some more TR with all the heat I was producting.</comments>

						<comments>Not a legit win. I realized after the game was over that I miscalculated the energy which would have thrown off the whole game because I was making lots of cash with Power Infrastructure (turn energy into cash).

Power Infrastructure is awesome if you can get the energy engine up high especially combined with the card that turns the heat into terraform rating. Getting temperature maxed out fast allowed me to use heat to bump my TR once every turn and use all my energy for funding.

This is the first time the starting neutral tiles really affected how I played. I had to work around the fact that one set split the middle of the plant zone. Also, I made a bonehead mistake putting down my first tile way out of the way of the plant/water zone. That hurt me getting the combo engine going.

I now see the power of animal/microbe/plant VP strategy when possessing both Decomposers and Ecological Systems... I HAD A TON OF CUBES for VPS! 
Score: 116</comments>

						<comments>Another nice win with Saturn Systems. Only got one Jovian tag down, so didn&apos;t utilize its power very much.  Built a good steel &amp; titanium engine with a tad of energy which eventually got sacrificed.  Built the capital for six points.   Space catapult was nice this time since it gave me flexibility in selling either a plant or a steel for 7 cash.  Worked great when I had extra steel lying around.  My cash production got all the way up to 17 by the last turn.  Extra cash was nice.</comments>

						<comments>Amazing win!  I didn&apos;t think I would win, because I star ted so slowly and invested heavily in Strip mining on round one to get steel and titanium production up.  Cost me three cards to play on my first round.  I was tapped out. Thankfully Teractor gives 60 starting space bucks.  What&apos;s shocking is that I had it terraformed by end of turn 13!!!! My last round involved putting down a city and  I think six greenery tiles to boost my score!!  </comments>

						<comments>Won with Ecoline.. 90 points.   I had an awesome plant engine going coupled with decent steel and money by turn 5.  Eventually got heat and energy going with a some titanium.

MC prod was up to 11 at one point and plant prod at 10 and heat at 6.</comments>

						<comments>First time playing two players with the real game and not VASSAL.

Really different to the solo game in that VP&apos;s are more a focus instead of terraforming.  Jachin got out to an early lead in money and energy.   He was playing cards like crazy.  By about mid game, I started to beat him in terraform rating and tiles down with cities and forests.  I had some nice point value cards and jovian tag points and animal points.  He claimed more milestones and awards for 20 pts and I got 10 points in milestones and  awards (Landlord and Terraformer)

Jachin really liked it when he didn&apos;t think he would. He says it&apos;s a top 10 game for him for sure.</comments>

						<comments>I won! Liandri Mining Corporation... 2nd win.

Got a good steel, energy, heat engine going early.  Then got my money up with a titanium and a little plants.  Near turn 10 every was kicking on high gear with heat maxed, money maxed, heat &amp; steel at 2, energy at 3 and plants near max.</comments>

Just barely came up short. Only needed one more water tile and I would have had it.  Had I not played Methane from Titan (28M), I would have had enough cash to finish out the game.  Turns out I really didn&apos;t need the card either.</comments>

						<comments>Played this on VASSAL solo, so I could learn the rules. A lot of wonderful options. I didn&apos;t even come close to getting the planet terraformed in 14 generations. I don&apos;t even know how people do it, since there&apos;s 40 parameter positions for adjustment in the game to get it to max, and you only have at most 28 actions in a solo game session.  It seems like you need lots of red cards to get it done, since they do double moves of temp, ocean, and oxygen.</comments>

						<comments>Played a Raid Mission with Tank Hunting Objective.   Basically to to location 5 and realized that I ran out of time to be able to get back home (Mission) in time.  Had like 6 turns left when I called the game done.  Our guys beat a hasty retreat.  We were overwhelmed location 5.  I risked placing location 6, but that turned into a mistake with all the new hostiles.</comments>

						<comments>Yes! We won December the first half to finish the game!  It was tight finish were we almost lost due to running out of red cubes.  Ironic in that it was our easiest to cure.  I was able to advance the search enough with binoculars to set up Jachin to finish it out, but we had to survive one more epidemic card which I drew before him.   We scored 770 points - just 31 points from Legendary.  Had we destroyed all the military bases we would have gotten legendary :)</comments>

						<comments>We stunk it up again on Case 9 - Solicitous Solicitor!  We got how he was murdered correctly and the hobby of one of the suspects.  We blew it on the murderer and the accomplice.  We took 10 clues, but at least sherlock took 8.  Maggie and Jeannie enjoyed themselves though.</comments>

						<comments>Epic!  My awesome searching soldier is Sagitarius!!!  He&apos;s the traitor! I had to tear him up and grab a civilian to finish the game.   We got the win, but we couldn&apos;t do character upgrades, since the civilian couldn&apos;t take any.  The medic and QS can&apos;t take any more upgrades.  We didn&apos;t eradicate a disease either :(  We didn&apos;t want to risk continuing the game, because it was close to the verge of getting out of control (a lot of 3 cube cities).  It hurts to lose the soldier, since he was so great at searching in faded cities with his ability to grab equipment cards for searching and his share rivals to give the medic cards.

Talk about plot twist as well!  We had 6 starting military bases and now we have to start tearing down the infrastructure we had set up.</comments>

Zoe had an awesome build combo going with her forum cards and almost built all her cities.  I got all my colonists down and got all the Mars cards.

						<comments>Play homegrown full variant with no board or pieces just card.  I handed out 4 cards and the remaining 6 were left in a row face down.  We could exchange cards with center row or peek at the card in the row for an action.  Once it goes all the way around, you hand a card to the next person.</comments>

						<comments>Another round with Scott AI.  Trounced him 80 to 67.   Kept him from building any wonders, but built all of mine.  Scored two nice guilds as well and got 10 military points.</comments>

						<comments>Crushed Eve and Jachin.  I heavily utilized the scouting/airfield/occupation strategy to full effect, and they did almost nothing to stop me.  I also did sneak and destroy to gain a few more points.</comments>

						<comments>Jachin blew us out of the water.  We conceded, so Eve could go watch her movie.  He probably would have ended up with 70+ pts, but we knew we couldn&apos;t catch up.</comments>

						<comments>Interesting game this time.  We went after each other more instead of spreading out.  Not sure how I won with so few units.  I used the Recon Force as much as I could although Jachin&apos;s Terrain Advantage was killer at times.  Playing Marines is so tight given less cards with the Occupation skill if used (Recon Forces helps some).</comments>

						<comments>Close game between Jachin and I.    Although, Zoe could have beaten Jachin had she won the last battle against him.  It would have been a 9 point swing to push her one point past him.

Jachin&apos;s shred drones were brutal.  Got to find a way to stop them.   I used occupation a lot, and probably got 16 pts off of it.</comments>

						<comments>I played machines and Jachin played marines.  Very tight and tense decision game, since it&apos;s only 5 rounds.  Came down to one final battle on last round for about a 7 point swing.  Really good game.</comments>

						<comments>Another win!  Month was August, and we couldn&apos;t get the immunologist! The trail went cold after 3 epidemics.  However, we now realize the power of the soldier being able to cycle the equipment cards (binoculars and grenade belts) for searching for the immunologist in black rioting cities.   We did get two more starting military bases, so we now have 6 starting military bases.</comments>

						<comments>Rocked it with the Galactic Exchange and Robotic Surveyors.  Nice combo getting two settlers back in your cup instead of citizenry and getting 2 credits to buy back dice that could be settlers.  Great way to put down worlds fast especially if you have military dice.  I was able to maximize the bonus for Galactic Exchange for a whopping 13 points.</comments>

						<comments>I thought Jachin was going to win, but I was able to scrape back for victory.  Stealth Fighter saved my but and scapping two cards from trade row to keep cards away from Jachin helped a lot. I was very poor most of the time, but I was also able to scrap down to efficiency.  He was Trade Federation&apos;ed up along with outpost.  At some, I think he had a 50 authority lead on me.</comments>

						<comments>Somehow... Jachin one.  Not sure what was the tipping point, since he was partially idle for a while. I was idle the most due to investing too heavily in continental to beat Jachin assuming it would be the dominant hotel (which it did).  We tied for majority.  Had I won majority it would have been closer.  I thought Zoe would win based on all the mergers she was in, but she must not have invested enough.</comments>

						<comments>Mom crushed me for her first game.  However, this was the first time I attempted to do 7x7 in the middle of the board.  BAD MOVE! NEVER DO THIS! You get near the end of the game and the one width rows kill you and force you to pass many turns to end the game.  No pieces will fit on it.</comments>

						<comments>Day 4. Mixed results.  Tried to tackle two 10 tank battalions: Tank Spearhead and Tank Force.  Use F-15 Air cover to eliminate helicopters on Tank Spearhead.  Missed a lot of tanks with Judge and his hellfires.  Almost destroyed, but didn&apos;t want to risk anymore damage to the harrier and his cannons.  Use B-52 strike to elminate other battalion, because my shooting was so poor and it wasn&apos;t going to be three aircraft on that mission ... just two.</comments>

						<comments>Eve crushed us with her double bonus from major routes.  It&apos;s lamed that the special operations cards has the same bonus for major routes that are on back of the action cards.  Eve scored 40 points for the New York to Kansas City route... lame.

						<comments>Day 3 of the General War in Israel.
Had a munition shortage, so I didn&apos;t want to fly alot of missions.  Also need to conserve SO points to do repairs and help Flash recover from so much stress.

Destroyed the tank leader that was encroaching past our front lines near the forward base we destroyed the previous day.  Couldn&apos;t elminate all the units, because an AAA vehicle dug into cover, and I didn&apos;t want to risk my slow moving Apache taking too many shots trying to close in on it.  Ended the misison with it remaining, but still enough to consider it destroyed.  Divot in his Harrier was tremendous again taking out the tanks with Mavericks.  He got a promoted at the end of the mission.</comments>

						<comments>Played first half of Iran campaign 2014 with Show in Force situation with Jachin.   First day was tough.  Only destroyed one battalion the and other was half strength. Using the linked aircraft is interesting, and I&apos;m not sure how much better they are even with the +1 attack.  The cheaper versions might have let us carry a Falcon into battle.</comments>

						<comments>Played 2 days of Iraqi 1991, Rapid Deployment. Started over since I&apos;m still learning the game. 1st day was okay.  I took on two battaltions with a single A-10 and single Apache, and reduced the battalions to half strength.  The 2nd Day was amazing. It was full of tough decisions and fortune was with me.  I took out the HQ.</comments>

						<comments>Got this in the mail today.  Busted it out and took me two hours just to organize, sort, and get to the start of the first mission. ... IT WAS AWESOME.  Even if I screwed up a couple of rules, I think that&apos;s a good sign.  I went to bed thinking about the game... another good sign...

I played through the 1st day and destroyed two battalions.  Lost one pilot on the very last turn off a mission due to a pop-up helicopter with 3 red hits!</comments>

						<comments>Played full solo game. I eked out a win at 55, 51, 45.  I had two very timely bank actions that saved my bacon, because the inflation rounds after it were 50% increases. I probably would have lost around 16 papiermarks total and would have cost me the game.  I was fokker, and I played against Halberstadt and Pfalz.</comments>

						<comments>Month of April. Our goal was to purposely lose, but get two diseases eradicated.  We were not able to accomplish this, because decided to go for the win, since the &quot;Faded&quot; started showing up this month.  We were able to eradicate one disease (blue) which gave us another mutation for a second disease, but it sure would have been nice to get red mutated a second time.  It was probably for the best.  The downside is that our Medic and Quarantine Specialist took the first scars of the game right as the faded showed up and had to draw the city they were stationed!  We picked the least debilitating scars we could determine to keep our medic strong and QS functional.</comments>

						<comments>Played Havox AI again.  Tried to test my weaver/vintner hypothesis. Even though I grabbed them, the AI wasn&apos;t building cloth and wine like it did last time, but dominated in tools and the smith.  I was able to build all the wine cities and claim Vintner.  I crushed him. 128-97.</comments>

						<comments>Good old 4th of july round with Mom, Angel, Eve, and myself.  We as always play with Fishermen of Catan and Harbor Master.  I went out to a huge lead early with a good placement on ore and wheat.  Things slowed down for me and I got the &quot;old boot&quot;, so I needed 13 to win.  I was eventually able to squeak it out although Angel and Eve gave me a run to catch up.</comments>

						<comments>Made it further second time around.  Died very hungry in the red phase.  Spend a lot of life fighting two tribes off in yellow, that left me very low.   I think my biggest mistake this and previous game was getting rid of my 0 card with +2 life. That probably cost me 6 to 10 life points based on cycling the deck.</comments>

						<comments>Started out better going for agriculture and spread out my tribes better to feed into cities.  However, I spent two hours just getting beat down particularly after things were looking good halfway through the 3rd era.  I had four cities and 9 total AV with 6 advancements.  Then it all went down hill for another era and a half. I quit halfway through the 5th era and was tired of the abuse that I had no control over.</comments>

						<comments>Little better this time. I think I have my head wrapped around visitations ... I think.  I assume visitation is attack if no shake hands are on card.  Got wiped out by an earthquake in second era.  It was brutal.  I had an epidemic and a tribal war that soften me up before the final blow of a level 12 earthquake to end me.  I consider it a win if I ever make it through all 8 eras.</comments>

						<comments>Zoe didn&apos;t play with us, so it was just Eve, Jachin, and I.   Since it was March, we chose to get the Operations Expert (named &quot;Cam Newton&quot;) to speed up one of our 2 objectives (place military base in every zone).  This turned out well.   We gave him and Quarantine Specialist the &quot;Friends with&quot; relationship which was okay.   We were able to win with 3 turns remaining, but we were tempted to go to the last turn and eradicate red a 2nd time.  We chose to be conservative and shut the game down, because were afraid of too many outbreaks would happen.

Our two upgrades were to place a permanent military base in Buenos Aires (level 3) and research center in Lagos (level 0).  We figured this could give us slightly better mobility at the start of April especially since we can place another military base at the start of the game.</comments>

						<comments>Really close game.  Came down to the wire.  Jachin popped me down to 1 point where I had a huge lead on him for a while.  I was able to swing it out in the end after he hit me down to 1 point on the last turn.  I thought I was done for.  He was using most of his DC Justice League (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman).</comments>

						<comments>Played the first mission of Falaise.  Jachin whooped up on me up the middle.  I can&apos;t believe how many center section cards he had. He was able to neutralize my two towns in the middle with his special forces.  Took out my Whittman unit.  I didn&apos;t go down easy though with my 4 medals. I could only tie him a couple of times before he would take the lead again.  He pressed in with one of his tanks to take the objective medal for the win.</comments>

Martinville Ridge.

I push through to get Hill 122 and kept it almost all game.  I had a lot of good cards to keep the attack on that end.  </comments>

						<comments>Breakout Campaign - Battle of Normandy
Operation Cobra.

This started as a slog of a game as usual.  Hard to come by even with an extra tank I called up in reserve. Jachin was tearing up my units in the rear with his P40 Warhawk.  I had a hard time sustaining the push up the middle with my tanks, but I was able to draw a timely Armor Assault to cinch the win for the final medal instead of leaving my armor stranded.</comments>

						<comments>Breakout Campaign - Battle of Normandy
Counter-Attack on Mortain

Jachin walloped me good.  I couldn&apos;t do hardly anything. His air strike and artillery bombard whittled me down.  I could only eke out 2 medals.  He won the battle, but I won the campaign with a major victory.  I have a commanding 4-0 lead in grand campaign points, so he can&apos;t win the whole grand campaign. Falaise is next.</comments>

						<comments>Mission 11 - partial completion. lost the sniper. We did play the xeno-grey wrong for 3 rounds - forgot to activate/teleport twice.

Update: Turns out we played the Arachnos incorrect, and probably would not have lost our sniper.  The arachnos would have stayed at the teleport point outside the ship.</comments>

I squeaked out a way to by my last support token with Harriet Beecher Stowe card and lost 8 slaves.</comments>

						<comments>I focused mostly on caverns first working on getting to the sixth dwarf.  I made it, but food was tight at first, once I got the sixth dwarf, I was able to supply food easily and finish the farm.  I got the treasure chamber, ruby supplier, state parlor (near 3 dwellings), and Broom chamber (10 pts for 6 dwarfs).  So,  I rocked it, big time.</comments>

						<comments>Barely got Grand Admiral Voss. Took 5 heroes and the second Forced Deployment came out late which would have killed us if we didn&apos;t take the Admiral out first. He was at six hit points.  Haka knocked him down good, but Tempest incapicated allowed Haka to deliver the final blow.

Legacy buffed up the damage, and Wraith dished it out. Absolute Zero couldn&apos;t get Cold Snap or Impale going, but at least he was healing up. </comments>

						<comments>Played a scenario from Campaign book.  Don&apos;t remember the name, but it was Germans invading a Belgium fort on a mountain to take out defensive positions.

Close game. I took out 3 turrets.  Jachin made a super risky move to claim the last medal.</comments>

						<comments>Played Omnitron the first time in Atlantis.  Kraken kept drones at bay.  Between absolute zero and wraith, we whittled the robot down. Az went down, but was able to finish off the last Droid.</comments>

						<comments>Grand Warlod Voss...got our butts kicked late in the game when Forced Deployment came out.  Didn&apos;t even count the number of minions...too many.  We didn&apos;t have enough HP to last the onslaught at the end of villain turn.  We did have the bad guy down to 13 HP.

BTW, we had 2 players, but 3 heroes, Legacy, Haka, and Tempest</comments>

						<comments>Jachin missed two key times to eliminate me, and didn&apos;t press hard enough. He had way too much energy before I took out the Everest.  I was scrambling for energy, because I was being more aggressive in my attacks.  Even with bad rolls halfway through the game, I eventually surged ahead.  It was tight for a while with my bad rolls.</comments>

						<comments>Cyberbunny just rocks with shrink ray. I misread the shrink ray card and thought you get a counter per claw, so I was eliminated early thinking this card was too powerful.  I finally figured out that it meant a token per any amount of damage dealt! DUH!</comments>

						<comments>Tried ephesus wonder with reds and blues, didn&apos;t go lean enough (too much money). Blue distribution was bad, did more green and red.  Scored well on just two red cards (13 pts).  Scored bad on green (one set) and one extra 13pts. Got Strategits guilds too.</comments>

						<comments>Bloody Ridge second scenario of Guadacanal Campaign and Island Hoppers Grand Campaign.

I dominated early because I had rolled &quot;cave construction&quot; allowing me to turn two hills into caves for Japanese.  One of the caves I put under the medal objective, and the other I put under a hill near my forces.  This allowed me to quickly get to the objective.  I kept drawing center assaults and attack center 3 cards, which allowed me to press the attack up the middle to capture both objectives and win 6-0</comments>

						<comments>3 players, dad, me, and son.

I stomped bad with something like 40 pts.  I could have had more, but I just ended the game with my big lead.

Dad played for the first time.  I think he had 10 pts.

Jachin came in second with about 20 pts.</comments>

						<comments>Scenario 11 - Liberation of Paris

Jachin made good rolls, but I got real good cards this time.  He should have mopped the floor with me with all those tanks.  He needs to keep them out of range of my infantry.</comments>
